            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE following Diſcourſes having amidſt my moſt ſerious Thoughts, been Penned at ſeveral times, and upon different occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and in this preſent Conjuncture, being like to be uſeful; as 'tis every one's duty in his Station, to lend a helping hand to pull down that <hi>Babel</hi> of erroneous Doctrines and of ſinful Practiſes, which the Author of Confuſion is Building very faſt; I think it not amiſs now to Publiſh them. The <hi>Firſt</hi> and <hi>Second</hi> contain Matters of Fact, the <hi>Third</hi> of Faith, and the <hi>Fourth</hi> both of Faith and Fact: and as the things therein ſpoken againſt, do ariſe out of an evil Principle, ſo they tend to a
<pb facs="tcp:174133:4"/>bad end, therefore the more to he minded and oppoſed.</p>
            <p>As Gods Word ſpeaks of Doctrines, ſo it doth of Works of Devils, and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> all of them be bad enough, and to be avoided, yet there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are divers kinds and degrees of evil, for tho' every ſin be offenſive to God, yet 'tis not equally deſtructive of Human Society: Any one, who in a ſober Senſe will mind it, not ſimply as a Chriſtian, but alſo as a Man, not only according to the Dictates of a good Conſcience, but alſo in Conformity to Reaſon, Human Wiſdom and Intereſt, ſhall find the two former things I write againſt, to have been and ſtill to be, as fatal and pernicious to Mankind, as any other Tranſgreſſion what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever of Divine and Human Laws, nor ever have they been more Epidemical in the Nation than now they are. Therefore never a greater need than now, to puniſh and ſuppreſs them; or elſe, if not timely prevented, we daily more and more ſhall feel the miſchievous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies and dangerous Conſequences thereof.</p>
            <p>No true Servant of God, but <hi>in ſeeing and hearing, will vex his Soul from day to day, with the unlawful deeds of Men;</hi> of ſome for committing Sins, of others for refuſing to reſtrain and puniſh them, they not only will do no good, but alſo hinder others from it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they think it will reach them, and their own corrupt inclinations hate to be croſſed and curb'd: Some who might do better in their Station, inſtead of promoting Piety, Virtue, and Honour, as 'tis their duty, do with all
<pb facs="tcp:174133:4"/>their craft and ſtrength oppoſe it, and thereby proclaim themſelves to the World to be vicious and thorough-pac'd Debauchees, would ridicule all Sobriety and Temperance, and contrary even to worldly Wiſdom, which ſaith, <hi>Si non caſtè tamen cautè,</hi> do not ſo much as care to avoid the appearances, or ſave their credit in the World, but glory in their own ſhame. In my opinion it is a ſtupendious hardneſs in their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious courſes, for tho' ſin would leave them, yet they are unwilling to part with it; the older they grow the worſe they are, their Natural ſtrength fails them, yet their Luſt is not mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, and upon all occaſions are Enemies to Virtue, and by their Diſcourſes and Example, influence the younger ſort, in an Age that can produce but few <hi>Joſephs,</hi> if any at all: The generality of Youth giddily and headlong runn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into ſin and deſtruction of ſeveral kinds, who are glad of any pretences to juſtify their Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, by and from thoſe that have more age and experience, tho' not more Grace than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: But of two ſorts of Sinners, young and old, I take the laſt to be the worſe of the two: 'Tis no more ſtrange than true, that they are worſe than the Prodigal Son, who upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, at laſt and before it was too late, <hi>came to himſelf,</hi> for all the while before, he had been out of his Wits, as is every Sinner that continues in his evil way: Nay they are worſe than Creatures void of Reaſon, then ſome Fowls of the Air,<note n="(a)" place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:174133:5"/>Scandal to our Holy Religion, and through their unchriſtian actings and vicious courſes; cauſe Gods Enemies to Blaſpheme: Becauſe they hate to be Reformed themſelves, they do what they can to hinder others from being Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, which makes me afraid we are here ripe for Judgment; we had a War with a Witneſs, yet after it are as bad as before; and now, tho' Proviſions be not ſcarce, yet we are in a kind of Dearth, for they are unreaſonably dear, may God be pleaſed to keep it from end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into a Famine, which frequent unſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Weather gives us juſt cauſe to fear; or, for the ſame cauſe from being turn'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Plague, which God in his juſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may ſend upon us, becauſe thorough Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, ſuppreſſion of Vice and Immorality, we will not return to him, tho' he hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led us to't, for when a Land can bear no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the wickedneſs of her Inhabitants, the Lord thorough War, Plague and Famine, as thorough ſo many ſluces, doth eaſe it of that burthen, and thereby hurries out of this World, Man, Woman and Child. None ſo deſperately wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but with <hi>Balaam</hi> would dye well, yet there is but one way to't, that is, to live well, do good within his Sphere, to puniſh and reſtrain Evil, and not countenance and ſupport it, as too many, directly or indirectly do, but what will be the end of this? certainly ſuch a bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Root can produce no other than bitter Fruits? but whilſt thoſe Men of the World will not obey God's Preceptive, thoſe who fear him muſt ſubmit to his Providential Will.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:174133:5"/>
            <p>As at this time the Nation labours under the Guilt of Adultery and Perjury, ſo it doth too much under that of Idolatry and Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Our Church, together with all other <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi> ones, hath ſufficiently made good the charge of Idolatry upon the <hi>Romiſh,</hi> which we find a ſad and frequent Experience of, in thoſe Members of hers we have here among us; as for Blaſphemy, it walks bare-fac'd, and hath two ſorts of Followers, one of abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable Monſters, lately broke looſe againſt the Son of God, whom they, after the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the 50th <hi>Pſalm,</hi> are not content to think, but do ſay, <hi>he is altogether ſuch a one as themſelves,</hi> and moſt impiouſly would make the Holy One to have given Example for their execrable wickedneſs, and, O wonder! ſuch Wretches meet with favour and ſupport. The other kind of Blaſphemers are thoſe which like <hi>the Soldiers, who, to make our Lord a Mock-King, platted a Crown of Thorns and put it upon his Head, and put on him a Purple Robe, and</hi> in deriſion <hi>ſaid, hail King of the Jews:</hi> ſo theſe with giving him the name of God but a ſecondary, depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and created one (if without Blaſphemy I may ſo ſay) make of him a Mock-God: the Soldiers after his death, took his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from him, but now, after his Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and ſitting at his Fathers Right Hand, theſe would ſtrip him of his Divinity, and of that Infinite Majeſty of his own, which he is cloathed with; and if one ſoberly tells them of this unwarrantable and ſacrilegious At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of theirs, he, for his pains, is called
<pb facs="tcp:174133:6"/>Furious, Mad, Frentick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> againſt which raſh Cenſure, and unchriſtian Judgment, our Saviour bath pronounced a Sentence, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall ſay to his Brother Raca ſhall be in danger of the Councel, but whoſoever ſhall ſay thou Fool, ſhall be in danger of Hell Fire:</hi> but all ſuch Men we leave to the great Judge, who one day will call them to an Account for theſe, not meerly Idle, but Evil words, at that day when the Cauſe ſhall not be between Man and Man, but between God and Man for all they have ſaid and done.</p>

Adultery imports a great Aggravation above Fornication, for there is Perjury, in as much, as in the Preſence of God, and of Men, a ſolemn Promiſe is made of being True and Faithful one to another.</p>
            <p>And although in the ſight of God, the Guilt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Man or Woman, be the ſame, and that even Death was equally Inflicted upon both: Yet in ſome Caſes, <hi>Moſes</hi> had a greater regard for the Husband than for the Wife, as in the matter of Jealouſie, no Remedy afforded for the Wife, but there was an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent and miraculous way for the Man to ſatisfy himſelf when he wanted Proofs, and this was the Water of Tryal and of Jealouſie, as we have it at large in the Book of<note n="(f)" place="margin">chapt. <hi>5.</hi> from <hi>12.</hi> to <hi>31.</hi>

               <hi>The man might give the wife, and ſend her out of his Houſe.</hi> But the Woman was not allowed to do ſo with her Husband: Therefore, as I already ſaid, thô in the Husband and Wife, in the ſight of God, whoſe Law makes no Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of Sexes, the Sin be equally Damnable, yet, as to Penalties, Laws are made to put a Difference; a greater Curb ought to lye upon the Woman as the weakeſt Veſſel, and ſo ſometimes more apt to miſcarry in Matrimonial Duties; but chiefly becauſe that greater Inconveniences are brought into Families, thorough Woman's Failing in this then of Man's: As to Men there is a great Difference, and this Sin is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with more dangerous Conſequences on the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:174133:9"/>Wife's, than on the Husband's ſide; if a man gets a Child by an Harlot, that Child ſhall not ſucceed in the Eſtate, but if the Wife hath a Child by a ſtranger, then ſtrange Blood is brought into the Family, to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud and Rob the true Heirs of their Right. This Corruption of Blood appears too much in ſome great Families, when the Pure Blood is ſtained with Baſe and Vile: Hence it may be that we ſee many who go for Sons of Great and Wiſe Men, who want com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Senſe and Reaſon, either out of ſome Natural Cauſe, or of ſome Particular Judgment of God, to Puniſh the Unfaithfulneſs of ſome Wives, or Neglect, and want of Care in Husbands, to prevent their Wives miſcarriages in that kind.</p>
            <p>We ſee our Laws have, in the Caſe of Life and Death, made a Difference in the Puniſhment to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted: If the Husband kills his Wife, he is to be Hanged, when if the Wife killeth her Husband, ſhe is to be Burned; the Husband is the Head, and the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt the Head is more ſeverely to be Puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed; and as 'tis ſo in matter of Life, ſo it ought to be in point of Honour: And the common, Opinion, and Experience of the World, teaches, how let the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sband be as Naught, Debauched and Profligate as can be, if the Wife be but Honeſt and Vertuous, her Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sband's miſcarriage, will not Reflect upon her; but the miſcarriages of the Wife are imputed to the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sband, becauſe 'tis his Duty and Intereſt, and hath Right, by all Lawful and Reaſonable Courſes, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it.</p>
            <p>Now, what this Lawful Courſe is, here I ſay it: After a Husband hath given his Wife gentle and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated Warnings, to mind her of her Duty, as to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the Company of ſuch Perſons as he hath cauſe to ſuſpect, and which he doth not like, and the Wife doth not mend, but goes on in her way, and (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that which every honeſt woman will do) ſhe holds Coreſpondence with ſuch as her Husband diſlikes, ſhe having ſo far forgotten her Honour and Duty, he ought to mind his, and Remedies to reclaim her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving uſeleſs, he may Sue for a Divorce, which was the Antient way, yet not upon ſo ſlight Grounds as pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed of Old, but upon ſuch as God's Word allows
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:174133:10"/>of, namely the the caſe of Adultery. <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> upon putting away his Wife, would ſay, Caeſar's <hi>Houſe muſt be free from Suſpicion as from Guilt:</hi> So a man ought to provide for both his Capacities, the one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rank and Station he is in, which he is to keep up, and not to neglect, elſe he will make himſelf Contemptible, and lay Stains upon his Family; the other is, as a Chriſtian he ought to purge his Houſe of Wickedneſs: to remove Evil out of it; the Head of a Family, is in Honour and Conſcience Bound to reſtrain in't all Evil Courſes, whether of Servants, Children, or Wife, or elſe he Sinneth in ſuffering that Evil, which he can, and 'tis his Duty to prevent; and will paſs for a Man void of all ſenſe of Honour, and who cares not a Straw for his Reputation. Such a Man ought to be aſhamed to live; thô I am not for making good <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Saying,<note n="(h)" place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>This matter is ſo Copious, and out of Scripture and Reaſon ſo much can be ſaid of it, that 'tis almoſt unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſtible, therefore, I intend, as much as I am able, to reſtrain it within Bounds; and in Order thereunto I ſay, after a Husband hath try'd all Fair Means to no Purpoſe, and he ſeeth the Diſeaſe is beyond Remedy, and finds how nothing can Prevail, then they, who will not do Juſt Things out of Love to Virtue, muſt feel Puniſhment inflicted upon them, a Divorce Sued for and obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Some Divines aſſign ſeveral juſt Cauſes, as they think, to break a Marriage, and others do Differ from them about it; but only Two I will bring, which generally are agreed upon. The Firſt, When Matrimony is Unlawfully Contracted; that is, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Degrees forbidden by the Law of God, as may
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:174133:10"/>be between Brother and Siſter, or the like, then indeed ſuch a Marriage is <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> void and null: But here I intend not to ſpeak of ſuch a kind of Marriage, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which, the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> hath often, and doth commit groſs and intolerable Abuſes, in a Diſpenſing way with that which God hath Forbidden; but my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign is to ſpeak of a Marriage Lawfully Contracted, whether there be any juſt Grounds out of God's Word, to break it off? For Marriage hath a Relation to't, and to the Good of Conſcience, in as much as it is a Divine Inſtitution from the Beginning of the World: Alſo, it hath a Proſpect towards the Laws of the Land wherein the Parties do live as Members of the Politick Body; and the warrant from the Word, is what I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend chiefly, if not only to inſiſt upon; for all Muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Laws are good, only as they agree with, and are not contrary to that Infallible Rule of Juſtice and Equity, which, when they Deviate from, are not to be Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued.</p>
            <p>There is indeed upon ſome Accounts, a great Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſes<note n="(k)" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.7, 8, 9.</note> it, between the Man and the Woman, whereof the Excellency is on Man's ſide, however that Prerogative of the Husband over the Wife hath ſometimes been abuſed, as by the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſo by other Nations, who would not ſuffer their Wives to recede, ſpecially in publick, from that Obedience they owed the Husband, for fear the Husband's Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative ſhould thereby be Wounded; upon this Ground Queen <hi>Vaſhti,</hi>

            <p>Wherefore I State the Queſtion thus: There is a lawful and only cauſe of Divorce, namely the Caſe of Adultery; what God ſaith about this in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, we already Examined; let us now hear what is his Pleaſure under the Goſpel.

               </note> in two places of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> decides the matter; the firſt is in his Sermon upon the Mount, where he Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns the common Practiſe of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who upon any trivial Account uſed to turn away their Wives, as when
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:174133:11"/>they did not pleaſe them, and the like: <hi>But I ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, that whoſoever ſhall put away his Wife, ſaving for the Cauſe of Fornication, cauſeth her to commit Adultery:</hi> The other Text is in the ſame Goſpel, where our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Argues the Caſe againſt the Phariſees, who had put the Queſtion to him; <hi>Whether it is Lawful for a Man to put away his Wife, for every Cauſe.</hi> In this place, he more at large ſpeaks to the Point, but to the ſame purpoſe; he makes a Diſtinction between the Law of God, which was from the beginning, and the Toleration of <hi>Moſes,</hi> only for the Hardneſs of their Hearts, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void greater Inconveniences, as Abuſing and Killing, when they were weary of them: <hi>Moſes</hi> did after the manner of <hi>Egyptians,</hi> only to prevent a greater Harm, give the People leave to put away their Wives out of a Politick Reaſon, but our Lord ſends them to the firſt Inſtitution, for therein he Vindicates the Law from the Abuſes crept in through ill Cuſtom and Tradition. <hi>Moſes</hi> Tolerated, not becauſe it was not ſin, but only to avoid a greater ſin, as might be, thorough the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſs of their Heart, making them away, as I ſaid already; and our Saviour declares why thoſe Divor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were Sins, (except in the Caſe of Adultery) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this made them commit Adultery, for God's Law ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit Adultery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I lay for a Foundation, that Humane Laws, when contrary to God's, cannot make this Void: And thô among Human Laws, ſeveral Cauſes of Lawful Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce be aſſigned, yet, as ſaid before, Divines and <hi>Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi> are agreed, that Adultery is a juſt Cauſe of it. Our Saviour decides it in an Emphatical way, <hi>But I ſay unto you,]</hi> as if he had ſaid, Thô others aſſign other Cauſes, yet I own but One, the Caſe of Fornication, and the Reaſon is, Becauſe '<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <hi>Two ſhall be One Fleſh:</hi> However, for the Woman's Credit, the Bill was given, as alſo to Secure her in the World; for ſhe was to be cleared from Guilt, or elſe
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:174133:11"/>to be put to Death, according to the Law. Divorce upon ſuch Grounds was contrary to the firſt Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Matrimony; for thô it be a Voluntary Act, yet after it once is Contracted, they may not thorough Fancy and Luſt, break the Bond of it; for <hi>what God hath joined together, let no man put aſunder.</hi> Only Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery doth it. <hi>Moſes</hi> complyed with that Humour of theirs; and that Indulgence of his, was not of a Moral Concernment, only for a time; Human Laws do condeſcend to the Abilities of Men, according to what they can do, but God's Law hath no ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, it ſheweth what they ought to do.</p>
            <p>To come cloſer to the Point: I ſay, Our bleſſed Saviour could not have ſpoken more clearly than he doth, that as no Man may put away his Wife, except in the caſe of Adultery, ſo in that caſe ſhe might be put away with a good Conſcience; and this is the true Senſe of the Words by the Rule of Contraries: For Chriſt ſaith, That whoſoever puts away his Wife, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept for Fornication, and ſhall marry another, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth Adultery; therefore he that puts her away for Fornication, and marrieth another, doth not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Adultery: Although it may not be Diſſolved at the Pleaſure of men; for 'tis not only of a Natural and Civil, but alſo of a Divine Right, being, as already obſerved, a Divine Inſtitution; yet 'tis not ſo Indiſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble, but it may be Diſſolved for a Cauſe, which God approves to be juſt for it's Diſſolution, and that is <hi>Adultery;</hi> for that Indiſſolubility is not Abſolute, but only in ſome Reſpects, and was not intended for a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, but for a Comfort to the Innocent: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Adultery, and ſuch Impurities, are a lawful Cauſe of a Divorce; and the Woman who hath Perfidiouſly broken the Conjugal Faith and Contract of Marriage, is juſtly put away and Divorced, and the Husband doth very well to proſecute her in Law for that End: And let the Succeſs be what it will, Chriſt abſolves the Husband, whoſe wife is Convicted of Adultery, from the Bond of Marriage.</p>

               <hi>Matthew,</hi> our Saviour hath a regard to, and explains the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Commandment, wherein is Forbidden, not only an Outward, but alſo an Inward Adultery; for the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:174133:12"/>Law requires Obedience in Thoughts and Heart, as well as in the Outward Act of the Body; ſo that Luſt is in God's Sight, Fornication and Adultery, and in the Law, Adultery, both in Deſire and Fact, is For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden; <hi>For whoſoever looketh on a Woman to Luſt after her, hath committed Adultery with her already in his Heart.</hi> And herein our Saviour oppoſes his True Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Law, to the Falſe one of the Scribes and Phariſees; and his Judgment he declares to be <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis</hi> or Oppoſition of an Exception forbidding Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce upon Trivial Accounts, but allowing it for a juſt Cauſe, namely if the Wife hath committed Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: We alſo muſt take notice, how in that Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made by our Saviour, <hi>[ſaving for the Cauſe of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication]</hi> He ſaith not <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Out of what hath been ſaid, I hope 'tis plain and clear, That a man may juſtly, and according to the Law of God, put away his Wife in the Caſe of Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery. As to the Queſtion, Whether the Husband's Fornication, as well as the Wife's doth break the Bond of Matrimony; and whether, in that Caſe, a Wife may put away her Husband Guilty of Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? I Anſwer, That thô the Husband's Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be a Breach of the Faith, promiſed and given his Wife, yet God doth not Allow the man's, but only the woman's Adultery, to be the lawful Cauſe of a Divorce: This was the Practiſe under the Law, the Husband gave the Wife the Bill of Divorce, but the Wife never to the Husband. And herein our Saviour makes no Alteration, thô he had a fair Occaſion to have ſpoken of it, and to the Purpoſe, in caſe it had been his pleaſure and mind to have admitted it, but
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:174133:12"/>nothing is ſaid in the way of Precept, Approbation, or Toleration, in relation to't; the Reaſon of this Diſparity on Man's behalf is ſhewed by St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note n="(b)" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.7, 8, 9.</note> 
               <hi>Man is the Image and Glory of God, but the Woman is the Glory of the Man; for the Man is not of the Woman, but the Woman of the Man; neither was the man created for the woman, but the woman for the man.</hi> Now the Laws call it Adultery, in as much as the Husband thereby Defiles his own Bed, but not that of another: But a Wife committing Adultery, makes the Adulterer to defile another's Bed, and bring in a ſpurious Seed into another man's Family; therefore God's Law<note n="(c)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Levitic.</hi> 20.10.</note> condemned <hi>both Adulterer and Adultereſs to Death,</hi> and ſo ſhould the Laws of every Countrey.</p>
            <p>That which made it a Capital Caſe,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.16, 17. <hi>&amp; Deut.</hi> 22.28, 29.</note> was the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's being Married; it was Death for any married or unmarried man, to lay with a married Woman, but 'twas not ſo with the man; for if a man, thô married, had enticed a Maid not betrothed, lain with her, he was to Marry her, or give her Dowry, in caſe the Father utterly refuſed to give her: A Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that may be aſſigned is this; That a man was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to have many Wives, but no Woman was allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have more than One Husband, which gave men a great preference above Women, and ſheweth how the Woman's Bond was within a narrower Compaſs and ſhorter than the Husband's; which comes up to what we ſay, how thô the Wives Fornication broke the Bond of Marriage, yet the Husband's did not. It muſt be obſerved how ſtrict the Law was againſt Women, in this kind of Sin, that if a Virgin was only Betrothed, and not actually Married, yet if ſhe had ſuffered her ſelf to be either Seduced, or unvoluntarily Abuſed, if ſhe had not cryed for help in the City where ſhe might have had it, ſhe was to be Stoned to Death, as appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the ſame Chapter. 'Tis obſervable,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Deuter.</hi> 22, 24.</note> that the Law, which appointed Sacrifices to make Attonement for many, and ſeveral ſorts of Sins, yet none there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was appointed for Expiation of Murther and Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, nothing but Death could do't.</p>
            <p>God's Law doth Forbid Adultery as well as Murther and Theft, ſo that Adultery is as much the Breach of the Law, as are to Kill and to Steal, and the Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:174133:13"/>in any Branch deſerve Puniſhment; but if there be any difference, the Severity was greater againſt Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery than againſt Theft, the Adultereſs was unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably Puniſhed with Death, but according to their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Laws, the Thief was not puniſhed with Death, but Condemned only to make a Reſtitution, ſometimes Two for One, ſometimes Four, and at other times Five for One, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. So that though, in Relation to God, both theſe were a Breach of the Law of an Infinite Majeſty; and ſo for both the Law required that Satisfaction, which no Finite Creature is able to give to an Infinite Creator; yet in relation to the Party wronged, the Penalty made a great Difference in the Puniſhment, the one being Capital, the other not. About this, here the Laws of the Land have made a great alteration; for Theft, when it reaches to a very ſmall Sum, which may be called as little as Nothing, is puniſhed with Death, when Adultery is not; which is quite the contrary of what among the <hi>Jews</hi> was practiſed. I know that the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Law being Aboliſhed, doth not at all Oblige us, but the <hi>Moral</hi> we are as much Bound to as they were; as to their <hi>Judicial</hi> Laws, thoſe which related to the Ceremonial indeed do not Tye us in the leaſt, but thoſe which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to the Moral, and are part and Explanation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, do.</p>
            <p>Now, one would think, it had been better in this kind of Laws, to have followed the Pattern of thoſe which God gave his People by the miniſtery of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but our Law-givers thought fit to do otherwiſe, and we may ſuppoſe they had ſome Reaſons for it, if there be any in and for ſuch things; for indeed ſometimes ſuch Circumſtances happen, as do much Aggravate the Nature of Crimes, as when they grow Epidemical, too Common, and too Frequent, too Bold and Preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous, then to prevent the Spreading, and other dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Conſequences thereof, the Legiſlative Power doth well and wiſely, and God's Laws allow them ſo to do, to put ſtronger Curbs, and lay greater Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties upon Offenders; the Civil Power is allowed to Enforce the Obſervation of God's Laws, but hath no Diſpenſing Power to Relax therefrom: Wherefore, if once the Legiſlative Power thought fit, upon occaſion,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:174133:13"/>to lay more Severe Penalties upon the Breach of One of God's Commandments, than there was among the <hi>Jews,</hi> much more may the ſame Power revive thoſe Penalties, which once were inflicted by God's Law, and make Adultery a Capital Crime, as it was among the Children of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> Certainly nothing can be ſaid, thô never ſo much, for changing the Penalty for Theft, but there is more for renewing the Puniſhment, which by God's ſpecial Precept was laid upon Adultery; for now that filthy Sin is as Common, Frequent, and Brazen-faced, and Odious, as ever it was, or at this time Theft can be, wherefore the Penalty for Adultery ſhould now be Death, as it was in the beginning: There is no Juſtice, Equity, nor Sound Reaſon, to puniſh with Death, one who Steals Half a Crown from me, and let another, who with bringing in Strange Blood into my Family, Robs it of Thouſands and Thouſands, to go Unpuniſhed. This, with hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Submiſſion I may ſay't, were too much for men <hi>with their Tradition, to make God's Commands of None Effect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another Truth I muſt make out, which is this: After a Divorce is made upon the account of Adultery, then the man is Free, and at Liberty to marry ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo that Uncleanneſs doth Intitle not only to a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration <hi>a menſa &amp; thoro,</hi> as by a new Unſcriptural Name they call it, of <hi>Board</hi> and <hi>Bed,</hi> but alſo it breaks off the Bond of Matrimony; and this Laſt is a neceſſary Conſequence of the Former; thô there are ſome men in the World, who allow a Divorce, but deny the Liberty to Marry another, miſgrounding their Opinion upon what is ſaid, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.32. <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall marry her that is Divorced, committeth Adultery.</hi> But any heedful man, to know the meaning of this latter part of the Verſe, will read the whole; <hi>Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall put away his Wife, ſaving for the cauſe of Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſeth her to commit Adultery.</hi> Then followeth, and <hi>Whoſoever ſhall marry her that is Divorced,</hi> Saving for the cauſe of Fornication, for this is Neceſſarily to be underſtood, <hi>committeth Adultery.</hi> Good, if ſhe be put away upon a Trivial account, and not for the Cauſe of Adultery; and in that caſe 'tis not to commit Adultery, or elſe our Saviour had Contradicted Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:174133:14"/>It were moſt Unjuſt to make the Innocent to ſuffer the Penalty due to the Guilty, which will be, if either he be forc'd to keep the Adultereſs, or to run the Danger of committing Fornication: And as once a Woman is found Guilty, ſo let her Suffer, Divorce be granted, and that which neceſſarily follows, leave be given the Husband to marry another, that being the Remedy provided againſt Incontinency, for as long as the Diſeaſe reigneth, the Remedy ought not to be taken away: Thorough Adultery is broken not only the Uſe, but alſo the Eſſential part of the Contract, and the Tye of it. The Innocent muſt not ſuffer, for 'tis not he, but the Guilty that breaks the Bond of Marriage; ſo that 'tis clear the Tye is broken, becauſe the Fundamental part of that Contract is, thus it cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth; then our Saviour's words admit of no Diſtinction, Reſtriction, or Limitation, they abſolutely approve of Divorce in caſe of Adultery, and not only in part from <hi>Board</hi> and <hi>Bed,</hi> as ſaid before: And every where in Scripture, the Word Divorce, implyes not only a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration between Husband and Wife, but alſo a Liberty to marry another.</p>
            <p>This Point is ſo generally allowed by <hi>Protestants,</hi> that 'tis become a Controverſy between the Proteſtant Churches and the <hi>Romiſh,</hi> for the Council of <hi>Trent, Seſs.</hi> 14. <hi>Can.</hi> 7. and <hi>Bellarmin de Matrim. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 16. ſay, That by Adultery Marriage is not wholly diſſolved, but the contrary we proved; and <hi>Pual</hi>
               <note n="(e)" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.27, 28.</note> ſaith, <hi>Art thou looſed from a Wife? if thou marry thou haſt not ſinned.</hi> Marriage is a Remedy againſt Incontinency, for ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>To avoid Fornication, let every man have his own wife,</hi> (v. 2.) <hi>and every woman her own huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</hi> And when there happens either a Voluntary Parting, or a Legal Divorce, <hi>a Brother or a Siſter are free.</hi> Certainly, when the Bond of Marriage is looſed, as 'tis by Adultery, 'tis no ſin to marry, as the Apoſtle ſaid but juſt now; he who marries another, as long as the Bond remains undiſſolved, commits Adultery, but if it be diſſolved, 'tis no Adultery. The Argument is this: If for Whoredom the Man may put away his Wife, then the Bond is diſſolved, but for Whoredom, as our Saviour ſaith, the Man may put away his Wife, therefore for Whoredom the Bond is diſſolved, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:174133:14"/>ſo he may marry another; except for Fornication, that is, without the Cauſe of Fornication, is an Exception, which happening to be the Caſe, he is allowed to put her away. Now Chriſt's Exception, except it be for Fornication, is jointly to be extended to both points of putting away, and marrying another; ſo, if he may put away, he may afterwards marry another.</p>
            <p>In all places of the Old Teſtament, where the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is about Divorce, it appears to be the Will of God, that upon ſome certain Grounds, it ſhould be lawful for Perſons lawfully Married, to make ſuch a Divorce as the Parties might marry others, and the <hi>Jews</hi> never knew of any other kind of Divorce but that, and this we have Inſtances of here among us: In the New-Teſtament, our Lord and Saviour, and his Apoſtles, never gave other Definition of a True Divorce than this; when it is lawfully made, it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the Innocent to marry again; in <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. he ſpeaks but of Two kinds of Divorce, one Unlawful, contrary to the firſt Inſtitution of Matrimony, when upon any unjuſt Ground a Man divorceth his Wife; the other Lawful, which is upon a lawful Cauſe, namely Adultery; he declares againſt the firſt, and concludeth for the laſt, whereby the Marriage is ſo diſſolved; that 'tis lawful to marry another Wife: And if, as it ought to be, by the Laws of Men, as 'tis by God's, the Adultereſs was put to Death, there would be no ground left for the Queſtion, Whether the Man may marry another Wife? And I think it a ſufficient mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigation of God's Law here, to ſpare her Life, when in many other Countries the Adultereſs is juſtly put to Death.</p>
            <p>Now the Two matters of Right are proved. <hi>1ſt.</hi> In Caſe of Adultery, one may Lawfully put away his Wife. <hi>2ly.</hi> Having Lawfully put her away, he may marry another. To this agree our famous Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Divines, and Caſuiſts, as <hi>Calvin, Beza, Martyr, Bucer, Piſcator, Perkins, Paraeus, Rive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wherein he proves the Lawfulneſs of a Marriage up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:174133:15"/>a Lawful Divorce. What the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church ſaith and doth to the contrary, is to ſatify her Covetouſneſs, and get Money for granting Diſpenſes. Thus the Court of Heaven and of Conſcience having declared, it concerns the Eccleſiaſtical and Civil Courts to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: When I ſpeak of the Eccleſiaſtical Court, I do not intend to make it a different one from that of Conſcience, for of all ſorts of men, Divines and Clergymen are tyed to the Rules of God's Word, and in a ſpecial manner bound to promote his holy Will therein contained, when occaſion is offered: They ought to have a watchful Eye over their reſpective Flocks; when they hear of, or obſerve any Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Practice in this kind, 'tis their Duty firſt to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh, and if this cannot prevail, to Proſecute as far as their Station will allow: If they were pleaſed to take notice of, and endeavour to reform the Abuſes that lead into this filthy Sin, which now we Write againſt, they, with God's Bleſſing, might ſometimes happen to prevent abundance of Evil committed in this Kind, with repreſenting how marryed women ought to avoid not only the Act of Adultery, but all Inticements to, and Occaſions of Uncleanneſs; as are Evil Companies, unlawful Sports; Dangerous Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, too Gaudy Cloathes, for their Apparel ought to be Modeſt; ſo to avoid Laſcivious Geſtures, and Obſcenous Words: for as in the <hi>7th</hi> Precept Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity is commanded, ſo whatſoever is contrary to't, is therein Forbidden; as Luſt in the Heart, the Eyes, or any part of the Body; Filthineſs in Diſcourſe, Gluttony, Drunkenneſs, or any thing elſe apt to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame Luſt. And as Matrimony is of a mixed, that is Divine and Human Right, ſo the Clergy-men, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially the Heads, ought in this matter to act in both Capacities, to Cenſure, Reform, Puniſh, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be Enemies to Abuſes and Abuſers in this kind. But 'tis a very ſad caſe to hear any of that Character, in a ſolemn Aſſembly, impiouſly to ſay, how ſome Expreſſions in Scripture, relating to the Point in hand, were Additions poſterior to the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, without naming any Author for it.</p>

               <hi>A Brother or Siſter is not under bondage. Thirdly,</hi> They ought not to Defraud one another of Conjugal Benevolence; for neither Husband or Wife have Power of their own Body, but mutually each of other's, as<note n="(e)" place="margin">

               </note> place. Theſe Duties married people muſt obſerve, as being the revealed Will of God, and when they are Broken, the Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Bond is thereby much ſhaken, but wholly Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved only in the caſe of Adultery, and the offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Party hath cauſe, if he pleaſeth, to Sue for a Divorce, which may not juſtly be deny'd, at leaſt a ſuitable Puniſhment, which though the Party deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not, yet I think the Laws ſhould Condemn the Offender to.</p>
            <p>Indeed, 'tis the Duty of the Supream Power, and Magiſtrates under them, to conſider of how great Conſequence this matter is for a well-regulated Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as 'tis certainly the Ground of all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: For what is a Kingdom but a Collection of ſeveral Shires, or Provinces? and theſe Shires of Cities and Towns? and theſe Towns conſiſt of Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, inhabited by Families; and theſe Families com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of Husbands and Wives, of Parents and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Maſters and Servants; whereof Husband and Wife are the Spring and Foundation: So that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever will have a well-regulated Nation, he muſt begin with Families, whereof Husbands and Wives are the Heads, which is to Build upon a ſure and good Foundation, or elſe 'tis in vain to look for pure Streams when the Spring is corrupt. Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers and Adultereſſes will Propagate a Spurious Brood, ſtained with Vices derived from the corrupt Blood of their Parents; for too often, on the Bad Side, the Proverb proves true, <hi>Like Father, like Son; Like Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, like Daughter:</hi> in ſome Families we ſee ſuch Stains, as the Ill Names, and Bad Courſes of Parents, do hinder and ruin the Fortune of Children. 'Tis then palpable how Superiour Powers are concerned to make good Laws and Rules, and to ſee they are Obſerved, whereby the Diſorders which happen in Families, to the Prejudice of Conjugal Duties, be Reſtrained and Puniſhed. Such good Orders will
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:174133:16"/>bring out, at leaſt in ſome good meaſure, Men and Women good in every Relation, better Parents, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Children, better Husbands, better Wives, better Maſters, better Servants, better Princes, and better Subjects. The Importance of this Truth hath been ſo well known by <hi>Popes,</hi> that where Popery is Predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant, they have Ingroſſed unto themſelves, almoſt the whole Power relating to Matrimony, with their Diſpenſing with Forbidden Degrees of Conſanguinity and Affinity, and with ſtarting new ones of their own Invention, ſtill reſerving for themſelves a Diſpenſing Power for Money; wherein Princes of their Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſuffered themſelves to be Fooled by them, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving firſt, by Fraudulent Suggeſtions, gotten the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Power into their own Hands, and afterwards, by Force, drawn to themſelves the whole Authority of Judging and Determining in Matrimonial Cauſes, as in moſt other matters.</p>
            <p>Somewhat before we ſaid, how the Civil Law is for us, now we muſt briefly ſhew it. Some of the firſt Chriſtian Emperours, (as well as ſome Heathen before) to <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> and after, being ſenſible of the Neceſſity of Preventing Abuſes in this matter, by the Advice of able and wiſe Judges, made Laws to grant Divorces for certain Cauſes: Such, among others,<note n="*" place="margin">Cod.

If the Husband firſt hath deſired a Divorce, and Accuſed the Wife of a great Crime, as Adultery, let him Proſecute her according to Law, and obtain Vengeance, that is, Divorce, and enjoy the Portion and Downy; for ſo I take it to be the meaning of <hi>ſuam recipiat largitionem,</hi> and preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ntly muſt be free to marry another: He upon that account, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may Sue for a Divorce, which ought to be Grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but alſo to retain the Portion and Dowry, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:174133:17"/>ſo leave her to the wide World without Maintainance, and alſo marry another: Nay, if 'twas only upon the Account of Ill Nature and Manners, and not for Crimes, Two Years after he may marry another; <hi>Si vero morum eſt Culpa non Criminum,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>etiam poſt biennium ducturus <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xorem:</hi> Which ſeems hard.

            <p>In the ſame <hi>Code,</hi> 'tis ſaid, <hi>Quamvis Adulterij crimen inter publica referatur quorum delatio in communi omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus ſine aliqua Legis interpretatione conceditur,</hi>

               </note> &amp;c. This Crime of Adultery was ſo Odious, that any one might be an Accuſer, but much more is the Husband con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, for in the ſaid Law it is added, <hi>Imprimis ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritum genialis thori vindicem eſſe oportet, cui quidem ex ſuſpicione ream Conjugem facere, nec intra certa tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pora Inſcriptionis vinculi contineri veteres retro Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes annuerunt.</hi> Here by this Law, a Husband muſt firſt Vindicate and Avenge the Honour of his Bed: And former Princes allowed him to accuſe his Wife upon Suſpicion, without Preſcription of Time; and tho ſhe proved Innocent, there was nothing of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment inflicted upon the Husband: 'tis wiſhed, here was in Caſe of Adultery, no preſcription of Time, as there is, for can any rational man ſay, That a Woman upon Oath of two or three Evidences, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed of Adultery, to be leſs, or no Adultereſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe is proved ſo a Year or two beyond the time of Preſcription? Is not a Murtherer, a Murtherer, indeed, and as ſuch to be Puniſhed, becauſe he is Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Convicted 10, or 20 Yeers after the Murther was Committed? 'Tis not a longer or a ſhorter time that can make that not to be a Crime, which is a Crime indeed. In my poor Judgment, I muſt ſay, any Human Law which preſumes to Diſpenſe with God's, is very Unreaſonable; God hath ſaid, Thou ſhalt not commit Adultery, abſolutely, without any Reſtriction, ſo that to commit it, is with every Perſon at all times, and in all places without Diſtinction, a Breach of the Law, and a Sin, and every Sin deſerveth Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aid no other Puniſhment upon him, than that he ſhould give back her Portion, or that called <hi>Donatio propter Nuptias,</hi> or Dowry; or if there were none of theſe, the Fourth part of his Goods. Thus the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, <hi>M.

He, tho otherwiſe a VViſe man, had not the Spirit of <hi>Julius Ceſar,</hi> who, as I ſaid before, gave no other Reaſon for Divorcing his VVife, than this; My Houſe muſt be as free from Suſpicion as from Guilt. Indeed, the Honour and Proſperity of Families, doth ſometimes ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the Good Behaviour, or Miſcarriage of a Wife, that no Husband may be Blamed for looking narrowly into it; and upon this Conſideration, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Laws allowed Husband's ſuch a Latitude in thoſe matters, tho ſome were apt enough to abuſe it; wherefore Chriſtian Laws have fixed narrower Bounds, The Cauſe of Adultery.</p>

But though we have our Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicipal Laws, Statutes, and Acts of Parliament, yet the Authority of the Civil Law is not to be deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, for it containeth much of Reaſon, Juſtice and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and was compiled upon mature Deliberation; and, as I ſaid before, by the advice and help of wiſe and knowing men; and here we are ſo far ſenſible of it, as therein to yield much to our Civilians, and <hi>Drs.

            <p>Now to enforce this the more; as we already obſerved, by God's Law Adulterers and Adultereſſes were put to Death, whereby the Bond of Marriage was quite Diſſolved; and ſo at this time it ſhould be here as in other places, then there would be no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to Sue for a Divorce, nor for leave to marry another. Now, an Adultereſs ought, at leaſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to be Dead, being covered with Extreme Infamy, which is directly oppoſed to the Covenant of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, which is<note n="(c)" place="margin">

            <p>I ſhall not ſay how an Incurable Impotency of Body, Madneſs, and Leproſie, are accounted juſt Cauſes of Divorce, much more Adultery is ſo, under both Old and and New Teſtaments; and Chriſtian Princes ought now to be as Careful as ever others were, to preſerve Honeſty in Families, which are to give a Seed unto the Church, to the Glory of God; hinder their being Tainted with Ignominy, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain Wickedneſs and Infamy. No Wiſe and Good Man will deny it to be the Duty, as it ought to be the neceſſary Care of Magiſtrates, firſt with Severity to Puniſh Whoredom and Adultery, as well as Theft and Robbery; for to Rob me of my Honour, and of my Wife, is to Rob me of my own Goods. Next they are to ſee that Marriages be Lawfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, then that they be faithfully kept. And laſtly, That upon Juſt Cauſe they be Lawfully Diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and leave granted again to Marry, at leaſt to the Injured Party: For God never intended in Marriage, to give a man a perpetual Torment inſtead of a Meet Help; neither doth God approve that to the Breach and Violation of this Holy Contract, which happeneth when Love ceaſeth, Murther ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, which is when Hatred doth ſucceed Love; for,<note n="(c)" place="margin">1 <hi>John</hi> 3.15.</note>

               <hi>Romulus</hi> made a Law, that it ſhould never be Lawful for a Wife to leave her Husband, but to him permitted to leave his Wife in ſome caſes, as of Adultery, Witchcraft, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that our Chriſtian Magiſtrates, if they will not make themſelves worſe than Heathens, when a Husband is a Sufferer by the Injuſtice done him by his Wife, and becomes a Plaintiff, there ought to be a readineſs in thoſe concerned to hear his Cauſe, to examine the Grounds, and at laſt to do him Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice: And this regardeth not only that ſort of Magiſtrates, that are intruſted only with the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive part, to ſee it done, but alſo thoſe in whom reſides the Legiſlative Power, to ſee that Laws be executed; and alſo, if Occaſion, and the Neceſſity of the Caſe requires it, to make new ones. Would to God, Magiſtrates would take ſuch effectual Care to Puniſh the Guilty in this kind, according to Divine and Human Laws, that no place might be left for Diſputes and Queſtions: The Adultereſs is not worthy of Compaſſion, only of Torments and Pains, chiefly when ſhe hath made unto her ſelf, an habit of that Sin, and no man may have the Charity for the Guilty, as to wiſh her not to be Accuſed, for Adultery is a publick Crime, which for it ſelf, and Terrour to others, ought publickly to be Puniſhed, and Diſcountenanced: And herein, after private Admonitions proved uſeleſs, to Diſſemble is not praiſe worthy, as ſome do fancy, for this Vice introduceth Diſorders into Families, Scandals into the Church, and Confuſions into the State. 'Tis eaſy out of Antient and Modern Hiſtory, to Evidence how For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication and Adultery have been the cauſe of the Overthrow of great Empires, of Calamities to Potent Nations, of the Ruin of great Perſons, and of very conſiderable Families. <hi>Abimelech,</hi> King of <hi>Gerar,</hi> a Philiſtine, who having nothing to do with the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, wanted the true fear of God, yet how do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>If Chriſtian Magiſtrates would but ſtrictly Execute that which Divine, and ſome Human Laws, have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, that Wickedneſs could be reſtrained, and the World not ſo much troubled and ſtained with it; but they indulge and wink either for Money, Favour, or out of Corrupt Inclination: They ought narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to look into, and Examine the Grounds, whether true or falſe. And as the Innocent is not to ſuffer, ſo the Guilty muſt not go Unpuniſhed, thereby to be hardened in their Evil ways, and become Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents for others to do the like. This concerns great Perſons more than Inferiours, for as they ſtand upon the point of Honour more than ordinary people, and to keep Infamy out of their doors, left it comes in, and ſtains their Blood to Poſterity, ſo they ought to help to drive it out of their Neighbours, and Peers Mouſes, and to keep it farther off from theirs; for that which to day is the caſe of one, may the next be that of another; and they who do not mind it, may be ſaid in a high degree to have forfeited a true Senſe of Honour, and to deſerve that Fire ſhould
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:174133:21"/>come into their Bed, which they would not help to Quench in their Neighbours. 'Tis too true, how Proſtitute Women generally find more Favour than the Vertuous, a ſtrong demonſtration of the Corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of the Times, and of the Depravation of the Nature of ſome, more than of others; and as <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptio optimi eſt peſſima,</hi> ſo where the greater the Honour ought to be, the more conſpicuous is the Infamy when men fall under it, Great Men may not be ignorant how their Inferiours fix their Eyes upon them, and they muſt have a care not to give juſt Grounds of Ill Opinion of their Behaviour, for elſe, inſtead of the Honour and Reſpect, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they might expect, they ſhall become Deſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and full of Contempt. In this World every one ought to anſwer his Character, and behave him ſelf as becomes his Quality and Station. The great ſign of a Man of Honour is for him to do nothing but what is Honourable, and according to the ſtricteſt Rules of Vertue; and keep Diſhonour out of his or her Family, for I ſpeak to both Sexes, for want of which care, men often bring upon themſelves a whole load of Infamy, and like a Carrion, thô alive, yet, above Ground, do Stink in the Noſtrils of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who in this caſe of Fornication and Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, are called to Judge between Party and Party, ought, as Scripture ſaith, to be <hi>men of Truth,</hi>

Wherefore 'tis their Duty and Concern, to Enquire into, and Examine things, not to deny Juſtice, but to render it, and puniſh the Guilty; and Examples muſt be made to ſtrike as Terrour into vicious Perſons, to Curb them from doing, out of fear of Puniſhment, that which they will not do for love to Vertue.</p>

            <p>Some will ſay, If Divorces be granted, then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently all will be full of them, and the beſt way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, is not to grant it.</p>
            <p>This is a general Objection drawn out of <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,</hi> againſt Divorces. Then, ſay they, a Gap will be opened for infinite ones; if the Innocent may marry, ſo may the Guilty, and many would be glad of Occaſions to put away their Wives to marry others; we know how ſometimes things are apt to be abuſed, but of neceſſary things, the Uſe muſt not be taken away for the Abuſe ſake; a Wronged Plaintiff muſt be Relieved, if there be Juſtice upon Earth; Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorcement of an Adultereſs is a Puniſhment for her Sin, now 'tis but Juſtice to Puniſh the Guilty: But to ſay, that a Marriage with another, after a lawful Divorce, is unlawful, and that a Divorce in the Caſe of Adultery, ought not to be granted, is as if one would conclude, that Judges muſt not puniſh Rogues, and Murtherers, becauſe ſo doing, would open a way to many Hangings; <hi>fiat Juſtitia,</hi> ſaith one, <hi>ne pereat mundus;</hi> Juſtice ſaves the World from Ruin. And thô there be thoſe, who to get an Occaſion for Divorce, would pick unjuſt Quarrels with their Wives, it doth not follow but that theſe who have a juſt Cauſe for't, ſhould be allowed it; Becauſe Thouſands of Innocent Perſons have wrongfully been put to Death, muſt not the Guilty as Traytors, Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, Murtherers, and Idolaters, be put to Death? Certainly, the matter is impartially to be enquired into, and as the Innocent is to be cleared, ſo the Guilty ought to be Puniſhed. Beſides, thô Divorces upon lawful Grounds were granted, that they ſhould thereupon ſpread ſo far as they pretend, that is not very likely, ſeeing among <hi>Jews, Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> where Divorces were allowed, they were not, as far as we read, very common neither, except they will ſay, we have among us many worſe men, than ever they had: I will grant we may happen to have as bad as ever they had, yet, to avoid one Inconveniency, we muſt not run into a greater one: The ready way to prevent both, is Impartially to do Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; for<note n="(c)" place="margin">

               <hi>he that Juſtifieth the Wicked,</hi> as well as <hi>he that Condemneth the Juſt, they both are Abomination to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:174133:22"/>the Lord.</hi> This I muſt ſay, how indeed 'tis very hard and unjuſt, for want of doing Juſtice in time, thereby to prevent Inconveniencies, to make any one run the Hazard of having another man's Child impoſed upon him, becauſe he is within the four Seas, and to Succeed in his Eſtate and Title.</p>
            <p>In matter of Treaſon, one Overt Act proves the Deſigning and Compaſſing of the King's Death, and bare Words, without any actual Attempt, are accounted an Overt-Act, and Treaſon doth reach not only to the King's Perſon, but alſo that of the Queen, and of the Heir-apparent to the Crown; nay, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of Falling upon the King's Guards is made Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: all this very well for the Security of thoſe lives, which the ſafety of the Kingdom doth ſometimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon. So, certainly a great Regard muſt be had to preſerve Right and Property, and to prevent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſions, Diſorders, and Confuſions in Families, which Evil is the more dangerous, becauſe it ſpreads the further, and becometh the more Epidemical, and may ſoon reach the very Vitals of the whole Government, and the Throne it ſelf; and thus a whole Nation from Head to Foot, become Sons and Daughters of Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Adultery: Therefore all imaginable Care muſt be had to put a Reſtraint upon ſuch Evil Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes as lead into ſuch Dangers. Now, as to Adultery, if, as we ought, we have a regard to the Law of God, the ſame Severity ſhould be uſed to puniſh it, as Treaſon and Murther; for God, who ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not Kill,</hi> hath alſo ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit Adultery.</hi> Hence it is, as I ſaid before, that by God's Law the Adulterer and Adultereſs were put to death, as well as the Murtherer. A Thief for ſtealing from me the Value of Eighteen-pence, ſhall be Hanged, and he or ſhe that Robbeth me of my Reputation, and my own Blood of my Eſtate and Succeſſion, ſhall go free and be unpuniſhed: This indeed is very ſtrange and un-equal.</p>
            <p>As to the Laws of men, I ſhall allow a Diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, how with ſome, Treaſon is a greater Crime than Adultery, (though with others both are Capital) ſo let the Puniſhment be leſs, not to reach to Life for Adultery, as for Treaſon, Murther and Theft:
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:174133:23"/>However, when we come to prove matter of Fact, there is in ſome Caſes for Adultery to fill up the Diſproportion: Shall not actual Attempts be Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to prove a Fact, as well as bare Words? If Treaſonable Words be proved againſt one, he is thereby Convict of Treaſon; and if a man be found alone in a ſuſpected place with another man's Wife, lockt up in a Room, and upon Oath in ſuch a diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and unbecoming Poſture, with ſuch other Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, not fit here to be named, which though they prove not <hi>rem in re,</hi> yet are not only ſtrong Preſumptions, but alſo clear Evidences of a Deſign, and actual Attempt to commit Adultery; much more when Fruits of ſuch Meetings appear, it may reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be concluded, ſpecially after a publick Noiſe in the World of ſuch Intreagues, that this is not the firſt meeting they had upon ſuch an account. When once Affections are Debauched, and both Parties wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to meet, they ſhall not want Occaſion, at one time or other, though never ſo ſtrictly obſerved, to indulge their Luſt; much more, if both Parties be free from any Watch ſet upon them: After ſuch E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences, doth not this cerrainly and juſtly deſerve the Penalty of the Law, namely, a Divorce? 'Tis a ſad and ſhameful thing, that among ſuch Chriſtians as make a Profeſſion of owning the Word or God's Laws, (eſpecially thoſe that are of a mixed Nature, and regard in part Religion, and in part Order and Preſervation of Society) ſhould not, as much as may be according to the Pattern of God's Law, the Rule of all Equity: but the Accident muſt be minded more than the Subſtance, and the Shadow be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before the Body, for want of one Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: And becauſe ſuch a Crime was committed within a Year or two before ſuch a Time, that is, before the Offender was Proſecuted for it, though proved Guilty, yet muſt eſcape. Is not an Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry committed Seven Years ago, an Adultery as well as that committed within theſe Four or Five? Can that Circumſtance alter the Nature of the Thing, and make that not to be Adultery, which is ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed? Shall we find Juſtice no where, on the Right, or Left-hand, Above, nor Below? After this,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:174133:23"/>one may ſay, 'tis not to be found among us, which way ſoever we turn ourſelves to have it: Then we muſt look up to God, who in his due time, will for certain render it, and may be with a Witneſs againſt the Guilty, and all that are Acceſſory to't, as are of all the Evil committed ſince, thoſe that ſpared and juſtified the Wicked.</p>
            <p>The Law hath ſo well provided in Caſes of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind: If a man hath ſpoken Threatning Words, he is Bound to his Good Behaviour. An Attempt of Rape, though not Executed, deſerveth Death, though this may be as Unvoluntary as Adultery is Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary. That party which giveth and expoſeth that which is not her own, ought to be Puniſhed as well as he who taketh that which is not his own: Now, we know, that<note n="(a)" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.4.</note>

            <p>It is known how our Laws make it extraordinary difficult to Prove things of that nature; 'tis a Work of Darkneſs, and ſo hard to be brought to Light, and when 'tis committed, the Guilty avoid the Light, do not ſeek for, nor admit of Witneſſes: Though Proofs by ſome, thought to be Competent, be brought in, which to give to the leaſt that can be, may, in the Judgment of many, be called ſtrong Preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet they go further when compared with the whole Carriage of a Woman of an Ill Reputation, who careth not to take any pains to remove the evil Opinion which people have of her; a Behaviour ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry different from that which Perſons of that Sex, and of Honour, hold to redeem their Reputation, when it falls into Jeopardy and under Cenſure. Once 'twas here the Caſe of a Nobleman upon the account of Adultery, to Sue for a Divorce, which was obtained, and he Married again, which may be a Precedent to other Caſes of the like Nature.

            <p>But to return cloſe to our Point, and which is our main Deſign, to ground it upon the Truth of God's Word, which we lay our chief ſtreſs upon: Before I conclude, I deſire the Reader to remember what our bleſſed Saviour, the great and ſupream Judge, ſaid upon the matter, and to make him take the more notice of it, in few words, I ſhall make a kind of Recapitulation of the Subſtance of it; out of which it doth clearly appear, that in this point of Divorce, Two things occur to be Diſcuſſed, which our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Lord doth by his Authority decide, in the two places of <hi>Matthew</hi>'s Goſpel, already Quoted; in the firſt Occaſionally, when he purges of, and refutes ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral falſe Gloſſes, which the Scribes and Phariſees had put upon the Law: but in the laſt, he ſpeaks to't, as being the matter in hand, and directly to anſwer the Queſtion put to him, Whether for every Cauſe a Man might lawfully Divorce his Wife? Which he denyed, and gave reaſon for it out of <hi>Gen.</hi> 1, 27. and 2.24. But becauſe, as the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt Obſerves, they came unto him, Tempting him, and this deſign was, if poſſible, to make him Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict <hi>Moſes,</hi>

               </note> as at another time they would have done, in the Caſe of the Woman taken in Adultery, that they might have ſomething wherewith to Accuſe him; here to Intangle him, they brought in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Authority, who had commanded to give a Writing of Divorcement, but of it he gave a Reaſon, namely their Hardneſs of Heart, whereat they could not be pleaſed: And in the following Verſe, he Magiſterially and by his Legiſlative Authority thus Decided it: <hi>But I ſay,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe Words to be compared with thoſe of <hi>Chap,</hi> 5. which are Parallel, and about the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:174133:28"/>ſame Subject, as quoted before, and both do plainly affirm the ſelf ſame thing, which hath two parts, the firſt about Divorce, the Second about Marrying again after it.</p>
            <p>As to the Firſt there are Two Things, one Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the other Implyed, and this laſt as well as the firſt coutained in the Text: Our Saviour affirm that no man may Divorce his Wife, for every Cauſe, vain and trivial, as the <hi>Jews</hi> uſed to do, but at the ſame time he declares there is one Cauſe, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that, which he names <hi>Fornication,</hi> for which a Man may lawfully put away his Wife: For when he denies that any man may Divorce his Wife, except for the Cauſe of Fornication, at the ſame time he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth that Fornication is a lawful Cauſe to put her away, and every Divorce Grounded upon that Cauſe, and none elſe, Is Lawful; or elſe, why ſhould he make that Exception? If his Intention had been to Teach that there is no juſt cauſe in the World for a Husband to Divorce his Wife, he would ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely have ſpoken it thus, for no Cauſe whatſoever, and not have aſſigned one with an Exception, <hi>Saving for the Cauſe of Fornication;</hi> he muſt be Blind who cannot, or Obſtinate that will not ſee this Truth out of both theſe places.</p>
            <p>But they both do alſo afford another Truth, as a juſt and right Conſequence of the former; if the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce be unlawful, then a ſecond Marriage, is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, which by the Rules of Contraries implies, that if the Divorce be Lawful, then a Second Marriage is alſo lawful, ſo any man who hath put away his Wife for the cauſe of Fornication, may marry another, for there is no middle, either make the Divorce Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, and the ſecond Marriage Unlawful, or the Divorce Lawful, and a ſecond Marriage ſo. Theſe two things are ſo depending one upon another, and ſo much the Conſequence one of another, that we ſee our Saviour doth injoyn them together, that having ſpoken of the Divorce, he preſently and immediately mentions a Marriage of both Parties, in the 5th <hi>chapt.</hi> of the Woman, and in the 19th of both Man and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. 'Tis ſaid, Whoſoever ſhall put away his Wife, ſaving for the Cauſe of Fornication, cauſeth her to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:174133:28"/>commit Adultery: How doth he cauſe her to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Adultery? Becauſe ſhe Marrieth another; if ſhe would continue Single, there would be no Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery committed, but ſhe marrying another Husband, and the Marriage with the firſt holding ſtill, and not being diſſolved, becauſe Fornication which is the true Cauſe of Divorce, did not intervene, then ſuch Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages are meer Adulteries: So then, the Husband who hath unlawfully Divorced his Wife, if he marrieth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther committeth Adultery, and the Wife that is thus unlawfully Divorced, if ſhe marrieth another Husband, doth alſo commit Adultery; but neither Husband nor Wife, if lawfully Divorced, though he marries another Wife, and ſhe another Husband, do commit Adultery. as obſerved before by the Rule of Contraries: A ſecond Marriage is an Effect of a Divorce, ſo if the Cauſe be Good and Lawful, or Unjuſt and Unlawful, the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect muſt be ſuch.</p>
            <p>It is well known how by the Jewiſh Law and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, a Woman Divorced might and did marry ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and our Saviour finds no Fault with this, nor with marrying again, but with their Divorce without juſt Ground and Cauſe; for if they were lawfully Divor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, they might Marry again: For, as obſerved before, Marriage is the Remedy which God hath appointed againſt Incontinency, ſo that thoſe who are lawfully Divorced, if they have not the Gift of Chaſtity, as the Apoſtle ſaith, to avoid Fornication, muſt Marry, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. What muſt a Man do after he hath put away his Wife, and ſhe, after ſhe hath been put away, and they cannot Contain, muſt he turn an Whore-monger, and ſhe an Harlot? How can this be juſtified after a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Divorce? With <hi>Paul,</hi> I may ſay,<note n="(p)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.4.</note> 
               <hi>Marriage is Honourable with all, but Whore-mongers and Adulterers God will Judge.</hi> Heb. 13.4. In his due time, thô often,<note n="(q)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Prov,</hi> 8.11.</note> 
               <hi>Becauſe Sentence againſt an Evil Work, is not executed ſpeedily, therefore the Heart of the Sons of Men is fully ſet in them to do Evil.</hi> But let ſuch unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves apply what the Apoſtle ſaith,<note n="(r)" place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.3.</note> 
               <hi>Their Judgment Lingereth not, and their Damnation Slumbereth not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we proved the Point with clear Evidence out of Scripture, Human Laws, and ſtrength of Reaſon, which might be more Enlarged upon, if Occaſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:174133:29"/>it. This I muſt add, That 'tis a ſad Caſe, a loud and crying Sin, that muſt need reach up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, when Juſtice cannot be obtained againſt neither Adultereſs nor Adulterer, as if there was a Combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation againſt it, to provoke God and Men to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, till God's time be come to render it, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt juſt, never fails to do't when he thinks fit; but ſometimes when he doth, men take no notice of it, thô I think it to be one of the chief Cauſes of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vieſt and moſt frequent Judgments inflicted upon the Nation; for as it is one of, if not the moſt common National Sin, and none in Scripture more often, nor more ſtrictly Forbidden, as, moſt of any, contrary to God's holy and pure Nature; So thoſe who commit, and continue in it, muſt look for the moſt dreadful and terrible Judgments, which God's Juſtice, Anger, and Vengeance, for the Contempt of his Authority, and Breach of his Laws, can, in this World, and in that which is to come, pour upon wretched. and preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous Sinners.

In the mean while ſuch Practices of Swearing falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, do bring Diſhonour upon God, Scandal upon our holy Religion, and are a Shame to a Nation; and if not, as much as 'tis poſſible, Suppreſſed and Prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, God, the Judge of the whole Earth, will, in his due time, require it at the Hands of thoſe in whoſe Power it lieth, and whoſe Duty it is to do't.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, upon ſo juſt and neceſſary an Account I look upon my ſelf as Bound to give in my Evidence, and I Wiſh <hi>Judges, Jury-men,</hi> and ſpecially <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> may ſo take notice of, and mind what I ſhall ſay, as every one to do their Duty in their reſpective Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for herein I ſhall bear Witneſs for God as for men. And my great Motive why I now commit to Paper theſe few Lines, and Serious Thoughts of mine, 'tis only to bear Record unto the Truth! For,<note n="(a)" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.8.</note> 
               <hi>I can do nothing againſt, but for the Truth;</hi> which I think I am called to, thorough the Occaſion which is the Ground of all this. Which to Proſecute, I ſhall make uſe of both Law and Goſpel.</p>
            <p>I Thank God, when I appeared in this Buſineſs, I never but once before had been Summoned to bear Witneſs upon Oath, for I own it, I fear an Oath, the fewer the better, and the leaſt Account one is to give God about theſe matters; for therein Men, thô unwillingly and Ignorantly, yet thorough want of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, or ſome Miſtakes, are in danger of Failing: Wherefore I ſhall ever avoid, as much as I may, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought under an Oath, without a juſt and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Cauſe; raſhly and haſtily to venture upon't, is uſually attended with bitter Effects, and is the cauſe of much Evil of Sin as of Puniſhment from both God and men. He that eaſily and haſtily doth Swear, will as eaſily and haſtily Forſwear; for when he makes no Conſcience to take an Oath, he will make none to break it. Neither would I multiply Oaths, for many Oaths many Snares.</p>
            <pb n="47" facs="tcp:174133:30"/>
            <p>To go upon ſure Grounds and Explain the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, we muſt firſt ſee upon what Occaſion an Oath is taken, and what it is; becauſe too often, thorough the Unrighteouſneſs, Malice, and Craftineſs of Falſe and Self-ended Men, Truth is driven into Corners, which yet God in his due time, and ſometimes in an Extraordinary manner, will bring to light, to the Confuſion of the Wicked that would have ſuppreſſed it. Therefore, becauſe one man will not Truſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that men do ſuſpect the Sincerity, and are in the Dark about the Thoughts one of another, upon ſuch an account, God, who alone knows, and is the Searcher of the Heart,<note n="(b)" place="margin">

               <hi>An Oath for Confirmation to men, is</hi> (ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle) <hi>an end of all Strife.</hi> Not to ſow, foment, and promote it, and ſhelter Villanies under God's moſt holy and ſacred Name; for this overthrows the good Ends for which an Oath was intended, and perverts Juſtice and Equity, over-turns the whole World, and tends to Diſorder, Confuſion, and Ruin; all Effects of Perjury.</p>
            <p>Now, an Oath is a calling of God to Witneſs for the Confirmation of what we Say, or Promiſe: 'Tis a Religious and Neceſſary Confirmation of Things doubtful by calling on God to be a Witneſs of Truth, and a Revenger of Falſehood, which laſt part is much to be taken notice of, though many who Swear, mind it not; and there is a great Reaſon, why God ſhould avenge the Abuſe of his Name, for if often the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt men cannot endure to be named as witneſſes unto a Lye, how much more will the moſt Infinite, Glorious, True, and Holy God, ſuffer his Sacred Name to be ſo Abuſed, as to Shelter and Countenance a Lye?</p>
            <p>An Oath was ever lookt upon as a Thing ſo Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, that in all important matters, men could find nothing Surer or Stronger, to Tye one another to the Truth of what they ſaid or promiſed, then to put them to their Oath. Thus <hi>Abimelech,</hi> to make

                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.16.</note> 
               <hi>For Men verily Swear by the Greater,</hi> than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and that's by God, or in his Name, for Three Reaſons, Firſt, God hath expreſly Commanded it,<note n="(k)" place="margin">

Thirdly, Becauſe God alone knows the Heart, and he is able to judge of the Truth, or Falſehood of our Thoughts. So then, when we call God to Witneſs, we render that high and ſpecial Worſhip that is due only to him, for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we bear Witneſs that God is preſent every where, ſees and avenges all Falſehood and Unrighteouſneſſes of men, which things are proper to God alone: So then, to Swear in God's Name, is a part of his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, wherefore not only as we ſaid before, God Commanded to Swear by his Name, but hath alſo Forbidden to Swear by Falſe gods, and Creatures,

            <p>The Lawfulneſs of Oaths, by what we Obſerved but a little before, doth appear out of God's Precept, and Example: Whereupon we are to take Notice how God Sweareth by ſeveral of his Attributes, which he doth to condeſcend unto man's weakneſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, for we are apt enough to miſtruſt his Word, and therefore to give us gracious and infallible Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his Promiſes, and Threatnings too, he confirms them by an Oath: Thus he Sweareth ſometimes by his Life<note n="(m)" place="margin">

            <p>It is a Duty incumbent upon every one that takes an Oath, to Swear in Truth, that is truly, and nothing but what is according to Truth, not abuſing God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Now Truth relateth either to Divine things or to Human: To the former, when we entertain and have right Notions and Thoughts, due and reverend Expreſſions of things immediately belonging to God, as his Nature, Attributes, Works and Word. The Truth required in regard to Human Things, is either in common Society, and Dealings between Man and Man; or elſe in publick Judgments, in Courts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature, which concerns the Judges upon the Bench, fairly to Sum up Evidences, and impartially to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the Jury. 2ly, This Concerns the Jury-men, not to receive any Prejudices or ſuffer themſelves to be Byaſſed or Bribed, nor to ſtand too much upon this, that any of them will agree with the reſt, rather then to be Pinch'd, or Suffer in being lock'd up very long, when in their Conſcience they are Convinced that moſt of the reſt are in the Wrong; an Honeſt Man will ſay, I have rather to be Starved (though there be hardly once in Seven Years any ſuch Dilemma) than to go againſt my own judgment and Conſcience, which when thus wounded, will at one time or other riſe and fly in their Faces. 3ly, This regard's the Plaintiff, who is to promote his juſt Cauſe by Fair and Lawful Ways, without Falſe Accuſations, Subornation, or ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable Practiſes. 4thly, The Defendant, who in his own Defence muſt forbear uſing any malicious and unjuſt Means, and make uſe of none but ſuch as are according to Truth, Law and Reaſon. 5ly, The Evidences are concerned, whoſe Duty 'tis with bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing true Witneſs, to help and relieve their Neighbour in his juſt Cauſe, when 'tis in danger of being Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.

            <p>To Lie, is to tell for True that which one knows to be Falſe, or to affirm that to be Falſe, which he knows to be True. Though a man may ignorantly tell a Lie, yet not Lie, for to Lie implies a deſign for to Deceive or to Hurt, whereupon the difference is to be obſerved between telling a Lie, and Lying or making a Lie; for an honeſt and conſcionable man may happen ignorantly and imprudently to tell a Lie upon a Falſe Report, as of ſuch a man reported to be Dead, when 'tis not true; but to Forge a Lie, is with an evil Deſign, and to Deceive: the Intention and Contrivance is that which makes it Abominable; and, if it be ſo, as 'tis in ordinary Diſcourſe and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, how much more upon the occaſion of Oaths, when God's moſt holy Name is made uſe of, not in Private, but in Publick, and in Judgment, whereby Truth, which is part of Juſtice is perverted, and Lie, part of Injuſtice is ſet up.</p>

               <hi>Rahab</hi> made them Swear to; as alſo was <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Servant, as already Quoted; and this Oath of the Spies, at the taking of <hi>Jericho, Joſhua</hi> remembred to have it kept. Then the Mind and true Meaning of the Swearer is to be conſidered, what he aimeth at, when he doth Swear. So is the true and proper Signification of the Words made uſe of in the Oath, the meaning of thoſe who require, adminiſter, and take the Oath, muſt be very plain.</p>
            <p>Now, as not only Evil it ſelf, but alſo occaſions of Evil, ought to be avoided, it were fit and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for Magiſtrates when they tender an Oath, to proceed warily therein, and with great Caution, for fear of becoming Inſtruments of Damnation to thoſe who forſwear themſelves; wherefore it would be very Neceſſary not Indifferently to offer an Oath, but firſt to have ſome thing ſaid whereby men might well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what they are about, how Holy and Sacred it is, and how great the Danger to Swear to a Lie;
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:174133:35"/>or elſe for want of giving ſuch a warning, they may become acceſſory to the Sin of him who forſweareth himſelf for want of a due and timely Warning, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which the Law or Cuſtom are Defective; for none doth For-ſwear but he who Swears, and both Judges and Jury-men ought to be very Cautious how they believe one, who without Conſideration, runs him ſelf under an Oath, or who in his Depoſition, doth Stagger, Waver, or Contradict himſelf; ſuch ſhould be Diſcouraged, and the Teſtimonies of Witneſſes ought indeed more to be Weighed than Numbred. I deny not but that in neceſſary Occaſions, when a Man offers himſelf to Swear, he may, and ought to be admitted to take his Oath, or elſe this would put a ſtop to the Courſe of Juſtice; but I mean, that when one's groſly ignorant, or ſuſpected of being inclined to Perjury, ſomething ſhould be Ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to prevent it, and the Court be more Cautious how ſuch a one is admitted to Swear. So, hereupon thoſe who make uſe of them, ought in Conſcience be Wary how they bring them in, for fear of being partakers to other mens Sins.</p>
            <p>The Third thing for him that takes an Oath, is, To Swear in <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> or Righteouſly. That is, that the Matter by Oath to be Confirmed, be juſt, and lawful; for one muſt not Bind himſelf to any thing by Oath, but what is ſuch; for an Oath ought not to be made a Bond of Iniquity, as was done by thoſe wicked Fellows, that<note n="(a)" place="margin">

               <hi>If any man Treſpaſs againſt his Neighbour, and an Oath be laid upon him to Swear, and the Oath come before thine Altar in this Houſe, Then hear thou in Heaven, and do and judge thy Servants, condemning the Wicked, to bring his way upon his head, and juſtifying the Righteous to give him according to his Righteouſneſs.</hi> A Man hath Wronged his Neighbour, but he denies it upon the Accuſation, an Oath is laid upon him to clear the matter, the Oath to be taken in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple before the Altar; hitherto men have acted their parts, but can go no further, wherefore God's turn comes to act, though his Altar and the Temple be upon Earth, yet God heareth in Heaven, which is the great judgment Seat, the true Seat of Juſtice and Equity; and what's done after hearing, he judgeth between the Parties: And how? Firſt, Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the Wicked, that is, him who Prophaned his Temple, and his Altar, by a falſe Oath; then Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion followeth the Sentence, for he brings his Way upon his Head: And alſo he juſtifies the Righteous, and gives him according to his Righteouſneſs. Let all men that are brought to their Oath, take a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial notice of this, that God is both Witneſs and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venger; wherefore there muſt be an awful Reverence of God's moſt Holy and Sacred Name, which is made uſe of upon Occaſion, not upon Common and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial, but only neceſſary, juſt, and weighty Accounts. Wherefore the Nature and Uſe of an Oath, are to be known before one Sweareth. Firſt, the Nature, by conſidering three things, the Perſon to be Sworn by, that is, GOD; the Parts of the Oath, or the ſeveral Actions included and implied in it, which are Four; 1ſt, An Aſſertion by way of Affirming or Denying, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther barely, or with Obligation to, or from ſomething: The 2d, An Acknowledgment of God's Omniſcience, Almightineſs Juſtice and other like Attributes. The
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:174133:37"/>3d, An Invocation of him to bear Witneſs to the Truth of what we ſay. The 4th an Imprecation againſt our ſelves, if we do ſpeak Falſly; that is, a referring o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and offering ourſelves into his Hands to be Puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by his power and juſtice.</p>
            <p>Then the Purpoſe or Uſe, to which theſe Actions are to be applyed, are to be Conſidered; that is, the ending of a Controverſy, which otherwiſe cannot be conveniently ended. So that an Oath is a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Service of God, whereby we refer ourſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him as a competent and fit Witneſs and Judge of the Truth and Falſhood of our Speeches, about a Controverted matter, for the ending thereof. Now the Uſe of an Oath muſt be known in Two Things; <hi>1ſt,</hi> Of juſt Occaſions of uſing it; as when the matter is of moment, either in it ſelf, or in the Conſequents and Effects of it, as for the Satisfying of another that requires and will accept of it; or binding of one's ſelf either to another, as<note n="(a)" place="margin">

Alſo, in Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, that is, in Reverence to God, Care of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Good not Hurt unto our Neighbours, by Swearing, and Aiming at the right end, which is quietly determining of a Doubt by interpoſing God's Name, to ſhew our high Opinion of him; for thus God and Man have their due, and that is Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in every act, that every one whom it concerns, may have that which is due to him therein.</p>
            <pb n="61" facs="tcp:174133:37"/>
            <p>It muſt be obſerved how in matter of Oaths, there are an Affirmative and a Negative part, that is, Things Commanded, and Things Forbidden; for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of the Ten Commandments, when it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands a Vertue, doth at the ſame time forbid the Vices contrary to it, and when a Vice is forbidden, the Vertues contrary are commanded, though Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding is expreſſed in Affirmative Terms, as, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Sabbath-day, to keep it Holy;</hi> The Forbidding is declared in Negative Terms, <hi>Thou ſhalt not,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is contained every other Precept of the Firſt and Second Tables of the Law of God: Now men ought to take Notice how Negative Precepts are of a larger extent, and more binding than Affirmative; for theſe bind only <hi>Semper, non ad Semper,</hi> at Certain Times, not at all Times; but the Negative do bind Always, and at all times; as, I am bound to Help and Aſſiſt, and be Charitable to my Neighbour, but that is only when he wants my help, and as far as I am able, which I am not always, neither doth he always ſtand in need of being helped; but the Negative Precept goes further, for I ſtand bound never to hurt him, to do him Wrong and Injury at no time whatſoever. This I now take notice of in relation to the Third Commandment, not to take the Name of the Lord in vain, which I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak of, as being the Ground which in this matter I am to go upon, for therein the Abuſes of an Oath are forbidden, and 'tis Abuſed in Two ways: <hi>1ſt,</hi> In the Taking, <hi>2ly,</hi> In the Keeping thereof. In relation to the Firſt, as to the matter, for it's Object or Subject, for the Object, the Thing or Perſon Sworn by; for the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bject, whether Affirmative or Promiſſive: As to the Firſt, the Thing muſt be True, and the Oath Neceſſary, not Trivial, which deſerves not an Oath. As to the Second, the thing Promiſed ought not to be either Impoſſible, or Unlawful: As to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of uſing the Oath, it muſt not be taken <hi>1ſt,</hi> Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly. <hi>2ly,</hi> Without Cauſe, or juſt Inducement thereto. <hi>3ly,</hi> Irreverently. <hi>4ly,</hi> Ragingly, or in the bitterneſs of Paſſion. <hi>5ly,</hi> Maliciouſly, with a Deſign of Hurting any Man. <hi>6ly,</hi> Nor Falſly.</p>
            <pb n="62" facs="tcp:174133:38"/>
            <p>Have a great Care of Negative Oaths, wherein lays a great danger of Forſwearing, therefore not to be tendered nor taken, for they can be no Proofs, only ſometimes ſtrong Preſumptions: Indeed, one may well ſay, I never heard ſuch a man ſay ſo, or, I never ſaw him do ſo, but no man may ſay, He never ſaid or did ſo; he might ſay and do ſo, though you never heard or ſaw him ſpeak or do't. A Negative Aſſertion may by a good Conſequence be drawn from a Poſitive thus, Such a man, at ſuch a time, to my certain Knowledge, was in the City, therefore at the ſame time he was not in the Countrey, for at once he could not be in both places; but I may not Swear, ſuch a one, at ſuch a time, was not in the City, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I did not ſee him, for he might be there and you not ſee him, only in this Caſe, if the place be within ſuch a narrow compaſs, that he cannot be in't when you are there but you muſt ſee him; as for Inſtance: At ſuch a Day, and ſuch an Hour, we were Twelve at Table in ſuch a place, he was none of the Twelve, therefore he was not there, though one may ſay, he was not at Table, yet he may not ſay he was not in the Room, for he might be hidden in ſome ſecret part thereof. All this I ſay, to ſhew how Cautious men ought to be in point of Oaths; but I ſee this matter is ſo Copious, as I find it draws me very far, wherefore I muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain it only to my preſent Purpoſe, namely. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury.</p>

            <p>In that Third Commandment, by the <hi>Name</hi> of God, are underſtood his Nature, Attributes, Works, Word, and all Divine Perfections, whereby God hath made himſelf known unto us: As we are Forbidden to Abuſe, ſo are we Commanded to make a Right Uſe thereof, which conſiſts in the inward Frame, and Religious Diſpoſition of our Souls, in the Reverence we expreſs in our Words, and Diſcourſes about it, and in the Study we make, how to Promote it in our Lives and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations; that is, both Inwardly and Outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the Antecedent, Concomitant, and Conſequent Circumſtances thereof.</p>

            <p>By reaſon of the importance of this matter I ſhall now by the Grace of God in few words declare the meaning of that third precept whereof the end is, that God will have the Majeſty of his Name to be moſt Sacred unto us, and ſo muſt not be deſpiſed or unreverently prophaned: Hence followeth our duty, to uſe it with a Religious veneration: So that we muſt think or ſpeak nothing of God's Nature, Attributes, Works, Word and Ordinances, but with an awful Reverence, much leſs make uſe of it for ſelf ends or worldly Intereſt; but with a true ſenſe and tenderneſs of heart; never mention any thing relating to God, but therein admire and adore his Wiſdom, juſtice, Goodneſs and power; and when others are wanting therein, we may charitably warn them of their duty, which if ſlighted, the occaſions of coming into ſuch Companys muſt be avoided, not to be hearers and Wittneſſes of the diſhonour put upon God, and diſparagement to our holy Religion
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:174133:40"/>the true Chriſtian Reformed Proteſtant: for ſuch Men when once God hath left them to themſelves, they harden themſelves, turn the acts of Sin into an habit, then the cuſtom of ſinning takes away the feeling of Sin, from one ſin they fall into another, they daily<note n="(g)" place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.13.</note>

            </p>
            <p>Now if there be ſo much evil when Men do raſhly and unreverently take God's holy Name in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their lips, how much more then when 'tis made uſe of for wicked ends? And if God in this Precept doth exclude, as he doth, from pardon thoſe who take his Name in vain, how much more thoſe who ſlight, deſpiſe and prophane it to ſerve their own turns, and as we hinted before, an Oath is a calling upon God to be a Wittneſs of the truth of what we ſay, or of the ſincerity of our intention in what we promiſe. So Men ought to be very cautious of affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing but what they know to be true, and have a great regard to the nature and greatneſs of an Oath wherein God is taken to Wittneſs againſt the Soul of the Swearer if he deceiveth. And as a falſe Oath ought to be avoided, ſo a due conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ought to be had in taking of a lawful one, and this ſhould be in a legal way, I mean when lawfully called and upon a neceſſary Account; which, as I ſaid before, is part of God's Worſhip as expreſſed in the Prophecy about the call and confederacy of the<note n="(k)" place="margin">

The Underſtanding is the Light of the Soul, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it muſt be guided, and which without it lyes in Darkneſs, wherefore it concerns thoſe that appoint Judges to make choice of ſuch as God hath fitted for the place, and given them Endowments proper for it: But this is not enough, all Natural Gifts are defective without Grace, therefore the Heart of Judges ſhould be Sanctified with the <hi>Fear of God:</hi> This ought to direct their Knowledge, and here muſt be the Ground of all their Judgments.

Among the ſeveral Inſtances we have in Scripture of God's ſignal judgments, for breach of Oaths, this is a conſiderable one.

            <p>Theſe publick judgments are upon extraordinary Caſes, when Kingdoms have contracted this Sin, and no due care is taken to ſtop and puniſh it, the want of puniſhing it in private Perſons, ends at laſt in the Ruine of whole Nations, which I pray God may in due time ſeriouſly be conſidered: but becauſe the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of my Diſcourſe is about things not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo univerſal, as chiefly relating to the Courts of Judicature, and not to the Politick part of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, I ſhall conclude this Head with what God ordered in his Law to be done in the Caſe of Falſe Witneſſes; becauſe one man might out of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity or deſire of Revenge, Swear againſt another, God declared one Evidence not to be ſufficient, but provided there ſhould be Two or Three, as being ſuppoſed that Number would not ſo eaſily deſign a Man's Ruin, as one ſingle Man.

            </p>
            <p>This contains ſeveral very important Things. Firſt, That ſometimes, and too often, ſome men do riſe to Wrong their Neighbours, which when it happens,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:174133:49"/>as no man may be a judge in his own Cauſe, ſo the Plaintiff, to be Righted, muſt take lawful Courſes, and proſecute his Adverſary before Legal and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Judges, thoſe who at that very time are in Office and Authority. Here, beſides the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Judges, the Prieſts are named, for though the Civil and Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdictions be of a different nature, and not to be Confounded, yet matter of Oaths and Swearing being a part of God's Worſhip they to whom the Care of things relating to Religion is committed, God would have them not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, but to be preſent, to mind that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned his Service, the more becauſe at that time the Government of the Jews was <hi>Theocratical,</hi> or Divine, God ſo eminently and viſibly directing and ruling o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them; and therefore 'tis ſaid, both the men in Controverſy ſhall ſtand not only before the Judges, but before the Lord, the true Competent Judge; for upon all ſuch occaſions, the great Judge is ever preſent to obſerve how the Judges behave themſelves, who here are commanded to make diligent Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not perfunctoriouſly and lightly, but to mind and make it their Buſineſs: for, to ſpeak in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s words,<note n="[a]" place="margin">
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 25.2.</note> as <hi>'Tis the Glory of God to conceal a thing,</hi> ſo <hi>the Honour of Kings,</hi> and of Judges and Juries too, <hi>is to Search out the matter,</hi> till the Truth be found out, which being Effected, judgment and puniſhment are to follow thereupon, and the Miſchief the Guilty maliciouſly intended againſt his Brother, is juſtly to be retorted upon him. Thus this abominable Crime of Perjury is a great Evil to be put away from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong a People, for fear a whole Nation do ſuffer for the Wickedneſs of one, or ſome few particular men. and thus Juſtice being executed upon the Guilty, they ſhall be made Examples unto others, who Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhall Fear, and out of a Terrour of the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhall henceforth commit no more any ſuch Evil. This will prevent it's ſpreading further, and in the inflicting of this due Puniſhment, God's Command to the Judges is this, <hi>Thine Eye ſhall not Pity,</hi> no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy for ſuch wicked and miſerable Wretches, who are the Plague of Church and State, therefore both Church and State muſt ſet helping hand to root it out, and

               <hi>Judgment is turned away backward, and Juſtice ſtandeth afar off: for Truth is fallen in the ſtreet, and Equity cannot enter.</hi> But wo be to the Nation which is in ſuch a caſe, for thus the door lays open for Judgment; and 'tis well worth our ſerious inquiry, whether a due care hath been taken by thoſe who are concern'd, to prevent and puniſh this and other Epidemical Sins? which wholly to Enumerate, would prove a great work. I ſee too much cauſe to conclude for the Negative, and by what we feel, we muſt Judge of what we muſt fear: we have warning pieces enough, ſo the Murthering ones cannot be far behind, rather near at hand. We had a War with a witneſs, we are in a kind of Dearth, for tho' Proviſions be not ſcarce, yet are unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly dear; may God keep it from ending in a Famine, or being turned into a Plague, which the Lord in his juſt Judgment, when he pleaſes, can ſend upon us; for when the Earth cannot bear the wickedneſs of her Inhabitants, God thorough War, Plague and Famine, as thorough ſo many ſluces, doth eaſe it of that burthen, and thereby hurries Man, Woman and Child out of this World.</p>
            <p>But let us come nearer home, for 'tis neither juſt nor fit we ſhould entertain and cheriſh here that which abroad we declaim ſo much againſt, with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation. I for my part am afraid and was ever ſince I attained to ſome years of ripe knowledge and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, that Perjury and breach of ſolemn Oaths and Promiſes to God, is one of the great National Sins, for the Puniſhment whereof God who ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times uſes to puniſh one Sin with another, hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted it to ſpread ſo much and become ſo Epidemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal among us, and I further look upon it as one of the cauſes, of the Troubles and uneaſy burthens which the Land labours and groans under; and how many
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:174133:52"/>more may happen to be brought upon us, God alone knows, I am ſure if we may by the proſpect of preſent things judge of thoſe that are to come, we have much more reaſon to fear then to hope, except thorough a ſpeedy repentance we do prevent farther judgments for we muſt believe what the God of Truth hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that he will not hold him or them guiltleſs that do take his Name in vain; for this Sin, with Prophaneneſs, Uncleanneſs, Atheiſm, Impiety, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry, Blaſphemy, and ſo many more which like a dangerous Plague and deadly Gangrene daily gain upon us, except they be ſtopped thorough the diligent care and good example of the Government, Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy and Miniſtery, for with the Law I muſt mix the Goſpel, will certainly bring Ruin and Deſtruction upon the Nation.

            <p>That is in relation to God before whom we ought to Humble our ſelves and Repent: As to Men, Juſtice muſt be executed upon Offenders, or elſe the evil ſhall not be removed nor the accurſed thing put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, whereby Men become accurſed.

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:174133:53"/>the immediate Preſence of God, no man, that hath any ſenſe of Religion, would take the Holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of the moſt Sacred Blood and Fleſh of Our moſt bleſſed Saviour, to be a Witneſs to a Lie, and go out of this World with a Falſe Oath in his Mouth, to appear in the Preſence of the All-ſeeing and All-knowing God of Truth, to give an Account of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf! I am Charitably loth to believe any one is ſo deſperately Wicked, as conſidering all theſe Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, would Swear Falſly: If ſo, when any is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch an Account, brought to his Oath, let him look upon himſelf as at that very time lying under all ſuch Circumſtances, for he can be ſure of nothing to the contrary, it being not impoſſible for him to Dye at that time of a Sudden Death, which hath been and is ſtill the caſe of many. Now, I ſay, theſe Thoughts may work upon, and Influence one on ſuch an Occaſion, to ſay the Truth, and not to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer himſelf by any means to be Byaſſed in what he is upon, nor to have any Regard to thoſe he doth ſpeak for, or againſt, from the King that Sitteth upon the Throne, to the Beggar that lyes on the Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill; he muſt be Partial only for the Truth, and withal Conſider, that he Witneſſeth not for men only, but alſo for God, who is Concerned, called to be a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and whoſe Cauſe Truth is.</p>

               <hi>Even I know, and I am a Witneſs, ſaith the Lord.</hi> It ſhould make one Tremble to ſpeak a Lie in the Preſence of the God of Truth; as no man when he doth an evil thing deſires to have any one preſent, and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to what he doth, for as Evil is a work of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſo he that commits it in any kind, doth ſeek dark places, and avoids the Light, which would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove him for his Work; now, if one when he doth a bad thing is ſo unwilling, and afraid to be ſeen by any man, for Shame, from the Time of our Firſt Parents, is an Attendant of Sin, how much more ought one to be aſhamed, and afraid to do Evil, and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:174133:54"/>ſpeak Lies in God's Name, in God's own Preſence, and under his Eye, which none can avoid? This Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and Teſtimony of God, is the only way to clear and ſecure all things, at leaſt for time to come. Thus <hi>Samuel,</hi> upon his going out of this World, takes great care to make all things even between himſelf and the People;<note n="(m)" place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12, 3, 4, 5.</note> how <hi>He had not Defrauded nor Oppreſſed them, neither taken any Bribe to blind his Eyes.</hi> The Truth whereof he calls God to Witneſs, to whom, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Death, he was to give an Account of. The People gave in their Witneſs, that he had ſpoken the Truth; but beſides, he had that of his own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but that of God was the greateſt of all, for therein lyes the Comfort and Aſſurance of a Good Soul; for,<note n="(n)" place="margin">1 <hi>John</hi> 5.9.</note> 
               <hi>If we receive the Witneſs of men, the Witneſs of God is greater.</hi> And this I Wiſh every man that is brought upon his Oath would Conſider well.</p>
            <p>Upon this Point, one thing more, I would Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to the ſerious Conſideration of Judges and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, namely, the Antecedents, Concomitants, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequents of Perjury, among other things, the Malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Deſigns and Contrivances, thorough the Sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions of the Devil, and Corruption of Man's Heart, whereby the Guilty do inure themſelves to, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in Evil things, thereby fitting and diſpoſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, thorough ill Habit and Cuſtom, to commit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Villanies in the World, according to their own Counſels, by which at laſt they fall from worſe things to worſt of all. Some of the Concomitants are Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, Hypocriſie, Deceit, Impiety, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all Puniſhable by the Laws of God and men. As to the Conſequents they are Dreadful, Pernicious, and Deſtructive; for thereby a Diſhonour is put upon God, and Occaſion offered his Enemies to Blaſpheme, a Scandal upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion followeth, with a Stain upon a Nation; this alſo will Ruin Perſons Families, and overthrow whole Kingdoms. After this, no man's Good Name, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Eſtate, Liberty, or Life can be ſafe and ſecure. So after this rate, no man may call his own, any thing he hath, thus farewel Property and Right: And what to Day is one man's caſe, may to morrow
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:174133:54"/>be any one's elſe, ſo Diviſion, Diſtraction, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction are at hand, as Effects of Oppreſſion, for thereby man's right and juſt Cauſe are oppreſſed, and we know what the wiſe King ſaith in the Caſe;<note n="(o)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.7.</note> 
               <hi>Surely Oppreſſion makes a Wiſe Man Mad.</hi> He that loſeth his own, loſeth his Wits, with a <hi>ſurely,</hi> therefore will he endeavour to ſee himſelf Righted; and if Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ways, becauſe they be Corrupted and Abuſed, do fail, then God knows what the next Step will be: Right oppreſſed, is ſometimes turned into Fury, and this is the ready way to ſet Men together by the Ears, and to make them to Cut one another's Throats, the <hi>Mine</hi> and <hi>Thine</hi> is the ground of Diſcord in the World, and therefore 'tis but juſt that every one ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy his own; whereupon God, the Sovereign Judge, ſaith,<note n="(p)" place="margin">

               <hi>I will overturn, overturn, overturn it, and it ſhall be no more, until he come whoſe Right it is, and I will give it him.</hi> Though Men will not, I will.</p>
            <p>Therefore when Perjury is found to be in a Cauſe which appears by Contradictory Depoſitions, for 'tis not poſſible for a Thing to be, and not to be, a man cannot at the ſame time be in Two ſeveral Places, ſo in the ſame Circumſtance of a Matter, one to Swear for, the other againſt, is a palpable Contradiction, for two contrary Oaths about the ſame thing, cannot be True, but if one be, the other neceſſarily muſt be Falſe; as if one Swears, that ſuch a man, at ſuch a time, was in the Countrey, and I Swear, that ſame Perſon, at that ſame time, was in the City, becauſe for ſeveral Days together, I met with, Saw, Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, had Meetings, Walk'd, Managed Buſineſſes with, and viſited him in his own Houſe, and I cannot believe that a Spirit had aſſumed that Man's Body to act all that part with me, nor that I ſaw a Viſion, or was in a Dream all that while.</p>
            <p>Hence it clearly appears, that there is a Perjury in the Caſe, for as ſome have Sworn the Truth, ſo others have that which is Falſe: Wherefore the matter is very well worth ſtrictly and narrowly Inquiring into, to find out the Truth, and ſee at whoſe Door the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury lyes, there to Puniſh it, that hereafter Men be not expoſed to the Mercy of ſuch Wretches and Villains. And what I ſay, is for one ſide, as well as for the other,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:174133:55"/>for I am Partial for neither, only for the Truth, the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of the Cauſe is what I ſtand for, and am no ways Byaſſed by the Merits of Perſons. Upon ſuch Accounts Men ought to Swear for no other End than to bear Record unto the Truth, which I pray God to Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, as he is the moſt True and Faithful Witneſs, and as he is the Great and Supream Judge, to cauſe an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary Puniſhment to be made of this loud and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wickedneſs, as they that are concerned to do it, ſhall anſwer to God at the laſt Day; for Judges, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Witneſſes, Parties, and every Man, ſhall ſome time, before the Iudge of the whole Earth, ſtand to be Tryed and Judged, when there ſhall be no Diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling nor Concealing of the Truth, but all things ſhall then be manifeſt, and be ſeen, even juſt as they are.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, what Laws are in being againſt the Crime, ought exactly to be put in Execution, and wherein they are Defective and Wanting, it may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be Supplyed by the Legiſlative Power, when thoſe in whoſe Hands is the Executive part, who have ſo many Occaſions to obſerve where 'tis Wanting, and where not, do according to their Duty repreſent it to them.

            <head>A DISCOURSE ABOUT INFANT BAPTISM.</head>
            <p>THE Doctrine of the Sacraments is of ſo high a Concernment in the great Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of our Salvation, that the Enemy thereof Satan, hath raiſed many of his ſtrongeſt Batteries againſt it: They are the Seals of God's Pardon, which he doth what he can to Tear, or at leaſt to Deface, thereby to Deprive us of the Aſſurance of God's Love in Chriſt. As to the Firſt, which is Baptiſm, how many Diſputes and Queſtions hath he ſtarted againſt it? With <hi>Papiſts</hi> we have
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:174133:56"/>no leſs than Seven about it, whereof the Two Firſt, relate alſo to the Lord's Supper; As firſt to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, There are but Two Sacraments, and they would have Seven. <hi>2ly,</hi> The Vertue of the Sacrament doth not depend upon the Intention of him who admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters it. <hi>3ly.</hi> It is not lawful for Lay-men or Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to Baptiſe. <hi>4ly,</hi> The Baptiſm of <hi>John</hi> had the ſame Vertue, and was as Effectual as that afterwards Adminiſtred by the Apoſtles. <hi>5ly,</hi> Baptiſm ought to be adminiſtred according to Chriſt's Inſtitution, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Addition, Diminution, or Alteration whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. <hi>6ly,</hi> Every Child Baptiſed, is not thereby Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated, and every one that hath the Sign, hath not the Thing Signified. <hi>7ly,</hi> Baptiſm is not abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary to Salvation, for ſome are Saved without it, but it ought not to be neglected or delayed.</p>
            <p>See how ſometimes God ſuffereth men from one Error to fall into another: and to maintain one they multiply others: Thus <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> to Aſſert that Infants ought not to be Baptiſed, hold the Quinteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Damnable <hi>Pelagian</hi> Hereſy; 1ſt, That they have no Sin. 2ly, That there is no Original Sin at all. 3ly, That no Sin comes by Nature, but is Learned only by Example and Imitation of others. 4ly, That all that dye in Infancy ſhall certainly go to Heaven, for none is Damned but for Actual Sins: Againſt what Scripture ſaith; Firſt, All Infants are Sinners,<note n="(a)" place="margin">

               <hi>by Nature we are children of Wrath, even as others.</hi> Then Secondly, Many Infants have been made Veſſels of Wrath, and the Effects of God's Wrath for Sin, are fallen upon them, as in the Flood, in the Deſtruction of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah;</hi> God's Order to <hi>Saul,</hi>

            <p>The Word <hi>Baptiſm</hi> in Scripture hath ſeveral Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications. It is firſt taken for the whole Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, inſtituted by our Lord; ſometimes for the Sign<note n="(f)" place="margin">

            <p>Here I intend not to engage in any Diſpute againſt all that are in an Errour concerning Baptiſm, my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign being upon ſome occaſion given me, only to Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate the Doctrin of Infant-baptiſm againſt <hi>Anaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptists.</hi> And to ſtate well the Queſtion, we ſay, and own, how men newly Converted, that are come to Years of Diſcretion, ought to give an account of their Faith before Baptiſm be adminiſtred to them. We alſo own, Children of <hi>Jews, Mahometans,</hi> and other Infidels, muſt not be Baptiſed, except God-fathers, or the like, promiſe before God, and in preſence of the Church, they will cake Care to ſee them Bred, and Inſtructed in the Knowledge and Fear of God: But to deny Baptiſm to Infants born of Chriſtian Parents, 'tis to deprive them of their Right, to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the Ordinance of God, to take away the Mark whereby they are diſtinguiſhed from Children of Unbelievers, to Cheat them of Chriſt's Livery, and the Badge of Chriſtian Profeſſion, 'tis, with <hi>Pelagius,</hi> to deny them Naturally to be Sinners, and not to need being Waſhed: And 'tis alſo to deprive Parents of the Comfort to ſee how God takes care to bring their Children within the Pales of his Church.</p>
            <p>Before we proceed further into this matter, to make it the Clearer, it is neceſſary, to go back, and ſay ſomething in general. In order thereunto, God hath not only made us Promiſes in his Word, but to help our Weakneſs, and ſtrengthen our Faith, hath

            <p>And as the Church of Chriſt is formed by degrees, and that daily ſome were and are added to it, ſo there are Two Sacraments inſtituted, one of Initiation, whereby we are introduced and admitted into't, ſuch was <hi>Circumciſion</hi> under the Old, and ſuch is <hi>Baptiſm</hi> under the New Teſtament, another to Feed, Streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and Confirm, ſuch was the Paſſover of Old, and now the Lord's Supper, which Sacraments of the Old and New Teſtaments, though they differ in ſome Circumſtances, yet agree in the Subſtance; both theſe of the New Teſtament,<note n="(l)" place="margin">

            <p>God is the Author of every Sacrament, none but God, who can give the Grace ſignified, hath right to Inſtitute a Sacrament, wherefore God inſtituted thoſe under the Old Teſtament, and our Lord, who is the ſame, thoſe under the New.

            <pb n="99" facs="tcp:174133:58"/>
            <p>There are Four ſorts of thoſe whom Sacraments are adminiſtred unto, for ſome have the Sign without the Thing Signified, others have the Thing Signified without the Sign; ſome others have both Sign and Thing Signified; laſtly, ſome have neither Sign nor Thing Signified,</p>
            <p>A Sacrament is an Ordinance of God, wherein God under viſible ſigns, doth repreſent ſome inviſible grace, in and thorough the Mediatour, therefore in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament are the viſible and earthly part, and the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and ſpiritual, which ſome call the outward and inward parts of the Sacrament. Then the Third thing is the <hi>Analogy</hi> and Relation between the Sign and Thing ſignified, and the Acts outward and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; and except one doth underſtand this, he can never have a right Notion of the Nature of a Sacrament. To demonſtrate it, I ſhall inſiſt only upon the Holy Sacrament of Baptiſm, which is the only Point I handle in this Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Water is the Viſible Sign in Baptiſm, and the Blood of Chriſt is the Inviſible Thing thereby Signified, the Analogy and Conformity is this; as poured or ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Water waſhes the Filth and Uncleanneſs of the Body, ſo the Sprinkling of the Blood of Chriſt upon our Souls, doth Purify them; for,<note n="(p)" place="margin">1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7.</note>

               <hi>Having our Hearts ſprinkled from an evil Conſcience, and the body waſhed with pure water.</hi> By this laſt, the Apoſtle alludeth to the ſeveral waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings under the Law, as to the uſe of Water in Baptiſm. Now, the Miniſter doth adminiſter the outward Sign and can do no more, but the Holy Ghoſt gives the Thing ſignified, and with applying it, doth purify and ſanctify us: to this purpoſe ſaith <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt,<note n="(r)" place="margin">

            <p>I Argue thus: Firſt, Under the Old Teſtament, Infants were Circumciſed, therefore under the New they ought to be Baptiſed; for there is the ſame Reaſon for Baptiſm under the Goſpel, as was under the Law for Circumciſion, which by St. <hi>Paul</hi> is called<note n="(k)" place="margin">

               <hi>the Spirit, and of Fire;</hi> yet this doth not hinder, but that the Circumciſion with Hands was the Sign of that made without Hands, as the Baptiſm of Water is the Sign and Seal of that of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. We conclude therefore, that all their Infants were Circumciſed, and all, as well as the Parents, were Baptiſed in the Cloud and Sea, for all paſſed thorough, ſo all Infants of Chriſtians ought to be Baptiſed.</p>
            <p>May be they will make the following Exception, which is not to the purpoſe, that according to this, only Males and not Females are to be Baptiſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe only the Males were Circumciſed, but as to this, the reaſon is different, for Females as well as Males are capable of Baptiſm which was not of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion; Men muſt not diſpute with nor be wiſer then God, who inſtituted Circumciſion at firſt, and now Baptiſm at laſt, having then appointed that feal, he commanded it to be applied to the part that was capable of it, and the fitteſt for his end, which was to ſhew the corruption of Mans Nature, and the caſting of that ſuperfluity was the ſeal of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to ſanctify <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, and we may ſay this ſeal was in ſome manner communicated to the Females: Now I think 'tis clear enough how under every Teſtament there hath been a Sacrament ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God to introduce thoſe whom it is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred to, into the Church; Circumciſion, was it in the time of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, as Baptiſm is in the time of the <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> this is the Key that openeth it for us, whoſoever doth not go in at this door which is the Ordinance of God, when he may,<note n="(a)" place="margin">

We read of ſeveral whole Families that were Baptiſed as that<note n="(d)" place="margin">

            <p>It is certainly a very cruel and uncharitable thing for a ſort of Men to ſhut upon Children the Church door of Baptiſm, to keep them out when God will have them to come in: Upon great and weighty occaſions, as of Faſting and Prayers of which in Scripture we have a very conſiderable inſtance, a great Army of<note n="(g)" place="margin">2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.13.</note>

               <hi>We ſay the Holy Ghoſt is in Infants Baptiſed though they know it not;</hi> and in his Sermon upon the words of the Lord, <hi>No body doubts but that Infants muſt be Baptiſed in the Name of Chriſt.</hi> And againſt <hi>Pelagius</hi> he proves Original Sin by the conſtant Cuſtom, of the Church to Baptiſe Infants, that Heretick and <hi>Sectators</hi> never gainſaid it, which he would have done, if it had not been ſo. But this I bring only to ſhew how Baptiſing of Children doth not come to us from <hi>Papiſts,</hi> as <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> would have it, but was practiſed long before the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of that Church, ſince 'twas by Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted after his Reſurrection.</p>
            <p>Now I come to Anſwer their Objections, the Firſt is, no Infants were Baptiſed in the time of the Apoſtles, and there is no command for it. To the Firſt part I anſwer, that though there be no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample expreſly ſet down, it doth not follow there was none, ſo we have no poſitive example that Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men received the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper nor expreſs command for them to receive it, yet we all admit them to receive it: To retort the argument upon them we ſay, there is no precept nor example why they ſhould not be Baptiſed.</p>
            <p>As to the Second part about the Precept, I ſay that thô we have it not in the very words and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, yet 'tis implicitly, and by very good conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, we deduce it from ſeveral Texts, as I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready have inſtanced in ſome; now 'tis a Rule in Divinity that the perfection of Scripture doth not conſiſt only in thoſe things which expreſly and in the very words are therein contained, but alſo in thoſe which by good and lawful conſequence may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced out of thoſe that are poſitive, which we look upon as Divine and oblidging our Faith; ſuch are <hi>Acts</hi> 2.25, 26, 27, &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.5, 6, 7. and others which it were too long to inſiſt upon: I only ſhall ſpeak to that of<note n="(p)" place="margin">

               <hi>Jacob</hi> were long before dead and buried, that is, their Bodies, but <hi>God being the God,</hi> not of the dead, but <hi>of the Living,</hi> it followeth they were alive, which could not be ſaid of the Body but only of the Soul; this as to the Immortality of the Soul, but the Soul is not the whole Man but only a part, now God is the God of the whole Man not only of a part, ſo being the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> he is God of his Body and of his Soul: but when our Saviour ſpoke, the Bodies of the Patriarcks were dead and cannot be living but by a Reſurrection. Thus in the ſame Chapter <hi>verſes</hi> 42, 43.44, 45. the ſame way of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is uſed: In all this, the analogy of the Word is to be obſerved, for it doth not contradict it ſelf, this is a neceſſary Rule for every one that will well underſtand Scriptures, there is no poſitive command to Preach to or Baptiſe <hi>Engliſh, Scotch, French, Dutch,</hi> &amp;c. but we draw the conſequence from this, <hi>Teach and Baptiſe all Nations,</hi> which is as expreſs a Precept as any can be.</p>

            <p>Fourthly, They Object thus, Children do not Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, becauſe they want the uſe of Reaſon, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought not to be Baptiſed.

            <p>I know, Knowledge, Aſſent, and Confidence in, or Relying upon God, to be the Three Parts of true ſaving Faith, that is begotten in us by the uſual way of the Holy Word; that Infants have theſe in the perfection of men of Riper Years, I do not Diſpute, but let thoſe who altogether deny Faith in Infants, take notice of the Difficulties and Inconveniencies they run into. For if Children have no Faith, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther none are ſaved, or if ſome be, then there are two different ways of Salvation, one for Men come to Years, the other for Infants, which doth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with Scripture: and according to that Opinion one muſt conclude Faith doth belong only to men of Riper Years, and not to Children: If ſo, what

            <p>But 'tis very difficult to ſay what manner of Faith, or to what degree, however we may ſay 'tis an Habitual Faith, a Seed and a Root, which though at preſent doth not ſhew it's acts, yet at laſt it will, like Seed under Ground, Fire under Aſhes, a Tree which will bear Fruit in it's due ſeaſon.

            <p>Yet ſuppoſe Children had neither Faith nor Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, it doth not follow they muſt be deprived of Baptiſm, for all this might be ſaid of Circumciſion, and yet God commanded Children to be Circumciſed, and to oppoſe this as contrary to reaſon, is to Diſpute againſt God, who would have Circumciſion a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Regeneration, (for as I obſerved before, 'tis called <hi>Circumciſion of the Heart,</hi> and <hi>without Hands</hi>) to be adminiſtred to Children, whereby we are taught 'tis not always neceſſary the Truth ſignified in a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, ſhould go before the Sign, ſometimes 'tis enough it ſhould follow, at leaſt in part; ſo that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept one would make (which were a kind of Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my) the Mercy of God leſs towards us and our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, than towards the <hi>Jews</hi> and their Seed, we muſt not deprive them of Baptiſm, the Seal of that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, no more than they were not deprived of Circumciſion, for by theſe Two Sacraments, God did and doth ſeparate ſome from others, to offer them his Salvation.

            <p>Some other things there are relating to this matter, wherein <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> differ from us, which we muſt not omit. The Firſt is about the outward Act uſed in Baptiſm: They would have it done with <hi>Dipping,</hi> whence they have gotten the Name of <hi>Dippers,</hi> and 'tis the ſignification of the Greek Word, whence comes the word Baptiſm. And though as much as we can, we muſt cloſe with the Ceremony of the Inſtitution, yet that outward Rite is not of the Eſſence of the Sacrament, and that which is uſed hath the ſame Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and Signification: It doth not appear any where, that they that were Baptiſed were dipped under Water, for they had been in ſome Danger of being Drowned, but that they went into the River, or other Water, and he who Baptiſed, as <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt, or other, poured it upon their Head, whereupon they were accounted to have been under Water, as in ſome kind they had been; but thoſe who at that time were Baptiſed, were perſons come to Years, and conſequently more able to reſiſt the Coldneſs of the Water in cold Weather, in caſe any Quantity had been poured upon them, which yet was but little. But leaving aſide the Difference of Climates, Hot or Cold, of Conſtitutions Weak and Strong, of Age Childhood and Manhood, or Inconveniency that might ariſe therefrom. I ſay, in the Church Sprinkling hath ſucceeded Dipping, and not without Ground in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, for the word Sprinkling is uſed for the Thing ſignified, and of this we have Two Witneſſes, St. <hi>Paul</hi> is the firſt,<note n="(e)" place="margin">Heb. 10.22.</note>

            <p>Another thing we differ in is, about Rebaptiſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Hence they are called <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> from baptiſing again thoſe that were baptiſed before. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth not rebaptiſe thoſe who from us turn to them, nor we thoſe who from them come to us, but <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> do all that come to them out of other Perſwaſions; and though the Lord's-Supper be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred many times, yet Baptiſm is not, or ought not to be but once, becauſe Baptiſm is the Sacrament of Initiation, and the Lord's-Supper of Nutrition and Increaſe, Baptiſm is a Regenerating, and the Lord's Supper a Confirming and Strengthening Ordinance. Now, as there is but one beginning of ſpiritual Life, thorough Regeneration, and there is but one Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction and admiſſion into the Covenant, ſo the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of theſe things ought only once to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, but as during our whole Life we need ſpiritual Nouriſhment, ſo the Sacrament of it ought often to be reiterated, as in our natural Life we are born but once, but we muſt Eat often to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve our Life.</p>
            <p>I muſt reſolve a Difficulty, and then I have done. 'Tis ſaid in one place,<note n="[g]" place="margin">

In that firſt place the Apoſtle exhorteth the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſians</hi> to Unity, for this reaſon, that our whole Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is grounded upon it, in it's Principle, Progreſs, and End, One God, One Lord, One Faith, One Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm, one Hope, one Body, and one Spirit, whereby all theſe are united: In conſequence of this, we find<note n="[c]" place="margin">

The Apoſtle doth not Inſtitute many baptiſms, for there is but One, that of <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt, and of Chriſt being the ſame, but the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of Baptiſm are ſeveral, as of Repentance,<note n="[k]" place="margin">

            <p>In the Primive Church ſeveral good Rites were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by thoſe who being of competent Age, were to be baptiſed, as the giving in of their Name amongſt thoſe who profeſſed themſelves Chriſtians, the Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation they ſubmitted to, and gave an account of the Progreſs they had made in the Chriſtian Doctrine, then the Confeſſion of Faith, and the Apoſtle's Creed amongſt the reſt was a renunciation to the Devil and to his Works, all which may well be continued in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to thoſe new Converts, who are come to Years of Diſcretion, before they be baptiſed: And herein we ſhall not diſagree with <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> or others, but as to Queſtions put to a Child newly born, when he is baptiſed, about that Renunciation, Whether he will forſake the World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Anſwer of the God-father and God-mother in his Name, is Ridiculous, and, as it were a jeſt, not to ſay worſe, in ſo holy and Serious a buſineſs; to ask queſtions of a Child, who can neither Hear, Underſtand, nor Speak, and take the Anſwer of a ſtander-by, who cannot well anſwer for himſelf, without a ſpecial Proviſo, as, if God thorough Free-grace will be pleaſed to enable him, and though one could anſwer for himſelf, it doth not follow he

               <salute>MADAM,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SOME few opportunities which, tho' in a kind of a broken manner, I had to diſcourſe with you about Religion, afforded me matter of ſad, yet charitable thoughts, for your Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual condition: 'Tis uſual, and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome grounds, to ſay there is in us a prejudice of Education, which ſometimes hinders from hearkning to things but reaſonable enough in themſelves; But it ſeems that hath had no influence upon your Ladyſhip, in the change you made of a Religion wherein you were born and bred; you over-looked all conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of that nature, and I am afraid, upon no ſerious thoughts or ſolid grounds: What Worldly proſpect you might at that time happen to have, and in that conjuncture, God knows, and I leave it to your own examination; but ſure I am, there could be none to balance the value of a Soul, which thereby you ventured the loſs of, to all Eternity: All the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World, and frailty of Human Nature, which is the beſt, and moſt that may be ſaid on your behalf, can never excuſe you in the ſight of God, nor hardly in that of Men, who have ſeen no juſt or reaſonable cauſe for it.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>Madam,</hi> what is paſt and done, cannot be help'd; yet out of a real deſire for your good, and to look to that which is to come, this I may boldly ſay, you can never anſwer it to God or men, if here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:174133:72"/>you be not acted by an earneſt care and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, to ſettle your greateſt concern in the World, the Salvation or utter ruin of your Soul; be very ſerious about it, and avoid not coming to a diſcuſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the matter, as ſome in your ſtate are apt to do. The Devil is the Prince of Darkneſs, and he hates the light, becauſe his works are evil; your Prieſts, who under the notion of a Confeſſion, and by means of an Abſolution, do Blaſphemouſly pretend to forgive your Sins. and a power to open for, or to ſhut upon you the Door of Heaven, do thereby Tyranniſe over your Conſcience, and will diſſwade you from coming to any Diſpute, becauſe, if the Word of God be the Rule, their cauſe cannot abide it. But as now, they have you in their Snares, ſo for their own ends, they will omit nothing to keep you therein; the Light of the Goſpel might diſcover their Cheats and Tricks upon the Souls of Men, and ſo make you to give them the ſlip, they will endeavour to keep you to this jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of theirs, namely, the blind Obedience, and to Believe what the Church believes, tho' you cannot tell what that is, to do what ſhe Commands, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble your ſelf no farther. But, <hi>Madam,</hi> ſuch Advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, and Ghoſtly Fathers, or Spiritual Guides, as you call them, ſhould by you be brought upon the Stage, and put to this Tryal: Come, I will hear what you can ſay for the Religion that I now profeſs, and againſt that which I left, a friendly and peaceable Conference I deſire about theſe things, between you and ſome Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or other <hi>Proteſtant</hi> ones. This, <hi>Madam,</hi> is the ready way not to be impoſed upon, and you, nor no body elſe, ought ever to refuſe being farther or better Inſtructed and Informed; and 'tis high time for you to begin in earneſt to go about it, for indeed I may ſay, you have been lull'd aſleep, tho' you wanted no warning from above.</p>
            <p>And becauſe for the good of your Soul, I wiſh I might be inſtrumental in ſo Chriſtian a Work, I ſhall here upon this Paper ſet down ſome few thoughts of mine, as are Conducing towards ſo great a Work. And becauſe the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves not very able, out of Scripture, the only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:174133:72"/>Judge in theſe things, to defend their Errors in Doctrine, they for themſelves have made what they call their Strong Hold, under the Name of the Church: For as Anciently the prevaricating <hi>Jews</hi> cry'd out <hi>the Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord,</hi> ſo <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Catholicks thunder out <hi>the Church, the Church,</hi> in hopes to ſhelter themſelves under ſo ſpecious a Name: But <hi>Madam,</hi> pray be not miſtaken, that glorious Name out of ſome peoples mouth is but a Scare-crow, and miſapply'd.</p>
            <p>That which at this time, I intend by the Grace of God to offer to your ſerious conſideration, is chiefly this, againſt the Primacy and Infallibility of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> Church, which indeed are the two Pillars it ſtands upon; for if you queſtion any thing, then to ſtop your Mouth, ſhe ſaith of her ſelf ſhe is Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and to get your Obedience, ſhe will ſay ſhe is Head Mother and Catholick Church, but then you muſt take their bare Word for't, if we may eaſily believe any thing, which we muſt not, when our Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal welfare lies at Stake. Before I have done, I hope, by the Grace of God, to prove this, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church hath no Supremacy over other Churches, and that her Biſhop is no Univerſal Biſhop, nor Primate of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall beat down the ground they go upon, namely, that <hi>Peter</hi> was the Prince of the Apoſtles, from whom they pretend their Supremacy to be derived, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I intend to ſhew how Popes are no Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors of <hi>Peter,</hi> neither 1. of his Doctrine; nor 2. of his Seat, or elſe he had been a Non-Reſident Biſhop, for he never was at <hi>Rome,</hi> at leaſt any long time; and this being done, I ſhall ſpeak againſt the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Infallibility</hi> of that Church and of her Biſhops, having before Premiſed ſome things againſt <hi>Peter</hi>'s In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falliblity.</p>
            <p>I muſt not engage in the Common place about the Church, which is of a large extent, yet I ought to take notice how the Word is ſometimes improperly taken for the Temple or Meeting place, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly for the Aſſembly or Congregation of thoſe who make part of the Body of the Univerſal Church, which being diſperſed all the World over,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:174133:73"/>and conſiſting of all ſerts of Men and Women, of every People, Quality, Age or Sex, for which cauſe 'tis denominated <hi>Catholick</hi> the true Members where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are for certain viſible only to Gods Eye, this Univerſal Church doth Subſiſt in the National ones, and theſe in the particular Churches: The Word Church is from a Greek Word derived from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which ſignifies to call from one place to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; here we muſt obſerve the unreaſonableneſs of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Society, which would be called the Church, excluſively to all that are not within her Pale, when there hath always been the <hi>Greek, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopian,</hi> and other Churches, ſtanding by themſelves, ſo now we have the Proteſtant and Reformed Churches from the Errors of the <hi>Romiſh,</hi> which conſiſt of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral National ones; and tho' in ſome of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named National Churches there be Corruptions, yet in none greater than in that of <hi>Rome,</hi> which all Proteſtant ones do charge with Idolatry: Beſides that Church commits a great abſurdity with calling her ſelf <hi>Catholick,</hi> when at the moſt ſhe is but a part of it, for 'tis a contradiction to be Univerſal par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, as the <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Church doth import, neither doth the name <hi>Roman</hi> make it to be that Church which was in <hi>Rome</hi> when St. <hi>Paul</hi> did write his Epiſtle, no more than the Jewiſh Church is now what it once was.</p>
            <p>Here, if I would enlarge, I might divide my Diſcourſe into three Branches; <hi>Firſt,</hi> What the Church is. <hi>Secondly,</hi> What are the Marks whereby to know her. And, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> What is her Authority. And therein according to the Etymology of the Greek word for Church, ſhew there are two ſorts or calling, one outward only, the other inward and joyned to the outward; but properly ſpeaking, the name Church comprehends the Aſſembly only of Gods Elect; for in the Church are two different kinds of Men, ſome are Members of Chriſt and the true Church, which are the Houſe it ſelf; others are indeed in the Houſe of God, but are none of it, like the Straw among the Wheat, till they go out and are ſeparated; of this ſort are all Chriſtians, Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal, Viſible, Particular Churches, wherein are the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:174133:73"/>pure Preaching of the Word, and the right Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the Sacraments, according to the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, which are the proper marks of Chriſt's Church, but in that of <hi>Rome</hi> they are very much corrupt; theſe I ſay, and ſeveral other things to the purpoſe, I might inſiſt upon, but for brevities ſake I ſhall forbear, to come to what I chiefly propoſed to ſpeak of.</p>
            <p>And that's, <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is but a Particular one, hath no right of Superiority, or Supremacy, over any other Particular Churches, ſhe hath no Patent for it; what Power ſhe hath in that kind, was gotten by Craft and Uſurpation, and was ſince maintained by force and violence. Jeſus Chriſt is the Head, King, and Maſter of his Church, and they cannot out of his Word, or Apoſtolical Practice, ſhew that ever he gave the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church any ſuch Priviledge or Prerogative, as I hope to ſhew't ſomewhat lower, 'tis but a Human Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtories aſſure us, that Patriarchs or Biſhops of <hi>Antioch, Alexandria, &amp;c.</hi> were Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent from <hi>Rome,</hi> nay, ſome of them ſharply cenſured the Biſhop of <hi>Rome:</hi> Indeed in the <hi>4th</hi> Century ſome Jarrings began, between him of <hi>Rome</hi> and that of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which being then the Seat of the Empire, was become the new <hi>Rome:</hi> But all was much, according to the Temper of the Biſhops then in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and for a proof that no ſuch Prerogative be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to <hi>Rome,</hi> in the <hi>6th.</hi> Century we read how <hi>Gregory</hi> the great, Biſhop of the Place, declared, that whoſoever called himſelf Univerſal Biſhop, or Biſhop of Biſhops, was the fore-runner of Antichriſt. Tho' not long after his Death, that Myſtery of Iniquity began to be ſet up, by a common Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, between <hi>Phocas,</hi> who having made away his Maſter the Emperor <hi>Mauricius,</hi> during a violent Fit he had of the Gout, promiſed <hi>Boniface</hi> then Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> that if he would procure him to be owned for Emperor, he would own him for Univerſal Biſhop; this is the true ground of that Uſurpation, and not any falſely ſuppoſed Gift of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, much leſs of Chriſt: 'Tis obſervable how about the ſame time, that <hi>Mahomet</hi> began his Impoſture, the

            <p>And becauſe, to engage the Conſciences of men, they would pretend to a Divine Right for this encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; we muſt in the next place, blow up and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow that imaginary Ground of theirs, which they fancy and would perſwade People to have been derived to them from St. <hi>Peter,</hi> but we ſay, <hi>nemo dat quod non habet,</hi> No man can give what he hath not. <hi>Peter</hi> never had any Primacy or Superiority over the other Apoſtles, and herein we go upon ſure grounds, for all along we have Scripture for it. Neither before our Bleſſed Saviours Death, nor after his Reſurrection was any ſuch Title as Prince of the Apoſtles, or the like, beſtowed upon him, nor any Power in the leaſt given him over them. In the School of Chriſt we hear Leſſons of Humility, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Pride and Ambition, and himſelf he gives for a Pattern, when he ſaith,<note n="(a)" place="margin">

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> 'Tis a <hi>Superſtitious</hi> Religion, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of innumerable vain Fopperies in their Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, wherein they place Religion, as the <hi>Virgins</hi> Milk, <hi>Peter</hi>'s Beard, <hi>Chriſtopher</hi>'s Tooth, the Head, Rib, Arm, Finger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of ſuch a Saint; ſuch things <hi>Rome</hi> is full of, and hardly any of their Churches but hath ſome ſuch things to ſhew: What are their Holy-Water, Salt, Spittle, Holy-Oil, Beads, Whippings, Fiſh-days, Nunneries, Pilgrimages, Baptiſing of Bells, Fonts, Croſſing themſelves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now let us look into their Rituals, and by their Practices judge of their Belief, and we ſhall find whole Almanacks full of Saints of their own making, I dare ſay of ſome who never were in the World, and of others who perhaps are now Tormented in Hell; they have many more Saints than there are Days in the Year: To theſe they pay the ſame Ceremonies, in the ſelf-ſame words, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſame bowings and kneelings as they do to God himſelf: Farthermore they directly to them offer their Prayers, Conſecrate Churches, appoint Holy-days, and make Vows to them, which are but Creatures, now Dead, and lying in their Duſt and Aſhes; if this be not Superſtition and Idolatry, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell what is ſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> 'Tis a <hi>Bloody</hi> Religion, witneſs their many Maſſacres of the <hi>Waldenſes, Albigenſes,</hi> and others; their <hi>Bartholomew-Eves</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> Cruelties in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and in ſo many other parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Canons of ſome of their Councils, their Inquiſitions and Congregations <hi>de Propaganda fide</hi> are well known. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That Religion is Damnable, for it overthrows the very Foundation of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, for their Tranſubſtantiation deſtroys the Truth of Chriſt's Human Nature, their Expiatory Sacrifice or the Maſs, his only Sacrifice for Sin, offered once for all, their Doctrine of Merits, his Merits; the multitude of Mediators among them, makes void the only Mediator between God and Men, the Man Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; their Sacrificing Prieſt overthrows Chriſt's Prieſtly Office, as their Traditions do his Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; ſo is the great Article of the Forgiveneſs of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:174133:80"/>ſins, and free Juſtification through Gods Grace in Jeſus Chriſt, by their Doctrines of Merits, Pardons, Indulgences, Treaſures of the Church, and Works of Will-Worſhip. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> 'Tis Blind, which is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made out by their Doctrines of blind Obedience, and implicit Faith: according to them, 'tis enough for one to be a good Chriſtian, to believe what the Church believes, tho' he knows not what the Church doth believe. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> 'Tis a <hi>Treacherous</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, for they teach, That the Pope may Depoſe Kings, and lawfully Abſolve Subjects from their Oath of Allegiance. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> we charge it to be <hi>Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,</hi> becauſe the peculiar Excellencies of Divine Majeſty, and the Prerogatives of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, it aſcribes to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> whoſe <hi>Pſalter</hi> by <hi>Bonaventura</hi> doth contain abundance of Blaſphemies, for all the Glorious things in the Book of <hi>Pſalms,</hi> ſpoken of the Son of God, they blaſphemouſly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it to the Bleſſed Virgin, who is but a Creature, and that which is proper to him, they give not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Virgin, but alſo (to multiply their Idolatry) to other Creatures, both dead and alive, as to their <hi>Popes,</hi> to whom and to their Prieſts, they attribute a power to forgive Sins, which is a downright Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, for <hi>who can forgive ſins but God alone?</hi> Mark 2.7.</p>
            <p>Now I come to the <hi>ſecond</hi> part of the Non-ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, and ſhew that <hi>Peter</hi> was no Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> or elſe he had been a Non-Reſident, and he never was at <hi>Rome;</hi> herein to be ingenuous, we ſhall ſay we have no poſitive proofs, but next to that we have that which is as good; neither can they with true and good Authority ſhew that ever he was there, though they make uſe of Legends and ſpurious things: and thoſe who hold the Affirmative, ought to prove it, though they which are for the Negative ſhould not; yet we hope to demonſtrate he never was Biſhop in <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After our Saviours Aſcenſion, <hi>Peter</hi> for ſeveral Years together continued in the Land of <hi>Judea,</hi> and thereabouts, for in the Book of the <hi>Acts</hi> we read of him in Chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. (tho' in this not particularly named, but contained under the Name
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:174133:81"/>of the twelve) 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. when, having by the Angel been miraculouſly delivered out of Priſon, he left <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where we find him again in chap. 15. for he was preſent at the Synod or Council, where <hi>Luke</hi> who followed <hi>Paul,</hi> and in the reſt of his Book gives an account of <hi>Pauls</hi> progreſs in Preaching the Goſpel, leaues him: Now the Council was held in the 15th year after Chriſt's Reſurrection, and the 48th after his Birth, till which time we cannot find he at all ſtirred out of <hi>Judea,</hi> except when he was in <hi>Antioch.</hi> where when for fear of the Jews, he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew himſelf from the Gentiles, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.12.</p>
            <p>Now let us compare times; <hi>Paul</hi> was Converted in the year of our Lord 35. and two years after his Aſcenſion, when going to <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> out of which City <hi>he was by night let down by a Wall in a Basket,</hi> Acts 9.25. thence he went to <hi>Jeruſalem, v.</hi> 26, 27. and <hi>was by Barnabas brought to the Apoſtles,</hi> he ſpeaks of another Journey which<note n="(a)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.18.</note> 
               <hi>three years after he took to Jeruſalem to ſee Peter, and abode with him fifteen days;</hi> and in the 2 <hi>Chap. v.</hi> 1. he ſaith how fourteen years after, <hi>he went up again to Jeruſalem with Barnabas,</hi> at which time he alſo met there with <hi>Peter, v.</hi> 9. and not long after at <hi>Antioch, v.</hi> 11. It were not to my purpoſe to follow <hi>Paul</hi> in his Journeys, nor to ſpeak of his abode in ſeveral places, as <hi>a year and a half at Corinth,</hi> Acts 18.11. <hi>three years at Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> chap. 20.31. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we ſhall bring him up to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> where, upon the account of an uproar a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, he fell into the hands of the <hi>Romans,</hi> when <hi>Faelix</hi> was Governour of <hi>Judea,</hi> and <hi>Glaudius Lyſias</hi> chief Captain in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and he<note n="(b)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 23.</note> was kept a Priſoner till <hi>Portius Feſtus</hi> came into <hi>Foelix</hi>'s room, Acts 24.27. and having been heard by him, and appealed unto <hi>Caeſar,</hi> was ſoon after ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he arrived in the year 58. and was Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr'd in the year 68. which was the 10th after.</p>
            <p>Now as to <hi>Peter,</hi> undeniably he and <hi>Paul</hi> were at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> at the time of the Synod in the year 48. as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved before, and they would have them both to have been Martyr'd in <hi>Rome</hi> in 68, that is 20 years after, yet they aſſert <hi>Peter</hi> to have been Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> for 25 years, ſo that there are plainly 5 years
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:174133:81"/>diſcount, beſides the time that he might have ſpent in and about <hi>Judea,</hi> for after that, as I already mark'd, we find him in <hi>Antioch;</hi> as for <hi>Paul,</hi> he was brought to <hi>Rome</hi> but 10 years after, which was but 10 before his Martyrdom, which in caſe <hi>Peter</hi> had come thither about the ſame time, had leſſen'd in all 15 of the 25. <hi>Peters</hi> firſt Epiſtle was written <hi>to the Jews ſtrangers, ſcattered throughout Pontus, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latia, Cappadocia, Aſia</hi> and <hi>Bithinia,</hi> from <hi>Babylon</hi> in the 56th year of our Lord, which was but 12 be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death: his ſecond Epiſtle to the ſame Jews, is ſuppoſed to have been written in 67. that is a year before his death, which he therein ſpeaks of as near at hand,<note n="(c)" place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 13.14.</note> there being no place named, we may well ſuppoſe it to have been written from the ſame whence the other was; yet therein no menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Rome,</hi> no ſalutation thence, no mention of <hi>Paul</hi> as being there, tho' he therein ſpeaks of him chap. 3.15. But to leave off Chronology; after the Synod of <hi>Jeruſalem, Paul</hi> doth mention <hi>Peters</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Antioch,</hi> but we find no where that he went or ſo much as purpoſed to go to <hi>Rome,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a place of the Gentiles, he had no call to invite him thither; but as already obſerv'd, we find his firſt Epiſtle written from <hi>Babylon</hi> (a City ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from <hi>Rome</hi>) for he gives the ſalutation of that Church, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.13. except they would have <hi>Rome</hi> to be called <hi>Babylon,</hi> as we read it is in the Book of the <hi>Revelation;</hi> but on ſuch occaſions the Names of places are ſet down as properly they are.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Paul</hi> was at <hi>Rome,</hi> we read it in Gods Word, but no ſuch thing of <hi>Peter;</hi> is it likely that he was 25 years Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and yet no ſign at all of his being there? I ſay, if ever he was there, it muſt be either before <hi>Paul</hi> came thither, or after, for with him he went not; not before, becauſe certainly ſome mention would have been made of him; we read how when <hi>ſome of the Brethren in Rome had heard of Paul and his company,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>they came thence to meet them as far as Apppii forum and the three taverns,</hi> yet not a word of <hi>Peter:</hi> if he had been among them, he being ſo conſiderable would have been named; well, but if it had been too much for him to go ſo far as to meet a
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:174133:82"/>Fellow Apoſtle, who once<note n="(d)" place="margin">

               <hi>went up to</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>to ſee him, and abode with him</hi> 15 <hi>days,</hi> and ſo was no Stranger to him, what's the reaſon when <hi>Paul</hi> was come to <hi>Rome,</hi> he came not to ſee him? if he had then been at <hi>Rome,</hi> doubtleſs <hi>Paul</hi> would have gone to viſit him, and not forgotten him when<note n="(e)" place="margin">

               <hi>he called the chief of the Jews together,</hi> and gave them an account of the cauſe of his coming thither; if then <hi>Peter</hi> had been Biſhop in <hi>Rome,</hi> the Jews would not have gone altogether without his knowledge, and their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſhews that <hi>Peter</hi> was not there, for<note n="(f)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Ver.</hi> 21.22.</note> 
               <hi>they ſaid unto him, we neither received Letters out of</hi> Judea <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or ſpake any harm of thee: but we deſire to hear of thee what thou thinkeſt, for as concerning this ſect, we know that every where it is ſpoken againſt:</hi> If <hi>Peter</hi> had been at <hi>Rome, Paul</hi> and his Doctrine about the Goſpel of Chriſt, could not have been ſuch a Stranger, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to them, let the reſt of the Chapter be Read, and 'tis ſaid, <hi>v.</hi> 30. that <hi>Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired houſe, and received all that came in unto him.</hi> What, all this while, not a word of <hi>Peter?</hi> we look upon <hi>Luke</hi> as an exact Writer, who in his Book of the <hi>Acts,</hi> mentions ſo many other particulars, and who all that while attended on <hi>Paul,</hi> and would he have omitted making ſome mention of <hi>Peter,</hi> if at that time he had been in or about <hi>Rome?</hi> Therefore we muſt conclude he was not there before <hi>Paul</hi>'s co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</p>
            <p>Neither came he thither after, for <hi>Paul</hi> in thoſe Epiſtles he hath Written from <hi>Rome,</hi> to the <hi>Galatians, Epheſians, Philippians, Coloſſians,</hi> II. to <hi>Timothy</hi> and to <hi>Philemon,</hi> which contain ſeveral Salutations from Men inferiour to <hi>Peter,</hi> yet not a word of him, if he had been there, <hi>Paul</hi> would have acquainted him with his Writing, as he did others, whoſe Salutations he mentions, then <hi>Peter</hi> would not have failed (to ſpeak in their own words) to have ſent his Apoſtolical Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, as now <hi>Popes</hi> do. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> is accounted to have been written within the 56th Year of our Lord, and 12 Years before his and <hi>Peter</hi>'s Death: Certainly if <hi>Peter</hi> had then been Biſhop of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:174133:82"/>
               <hi>Rome,</hi> according to their computation, of 25 Years, he muſt need have been there 13 Years before, and if in <hi>Rome</hi> at that time, how came it to paſs, that <hi>Paul,</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> among his Saluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to ſo many, much inferiour to <hi>Peter,</hi> omitted him. When the whole Chap. <hi>ib.</hi> is almoſt full of the Names of thoſe whom he doth Salute, and begins with a Wife and a Huſband, of whom we Read <hi>Acts</hi> 18.2, 3. who <hi>by their Occupation were Tent Makers, and he being of the ſame Craft, wrought with them.</hi> Of theſe he ſaith to the <hi>Romans v.</hi> 3. Greet <hi>Priſcilla and Aquila my helpers in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Certainly if <hi>Peter</hi> had been in <hi>Rome,</hi> and being an Apoſtle, in that Epiſtle <hi>Paul</hi> would, have taken notice of him. Therefore we look upon't as a meer Forgery that <hi>Peter</hi> for 25 Years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> for it had been contrary to the Office of the Apoſtles, which was not to ſettle in one place, but to go over the World, to Preach the Goſpel, as we Read of <hi>Paul,</hi> who from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and round about unto <hi>Illyricum,</hi> fully Preached the Goſpel of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.19. according to the Inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt, the Apoſtles divided the Work among themſelves, as we Read <hi>James, Cephas</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> do with <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas, Gal.</hi> 2.9. So all went into ſeveral parts of the World, which in anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Records, are named: as to <hi>Peter,</hi> about whom is the Queſtion,<note n="(g)" place="margin">Euſeb. l. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>1.</hi>

               <hi>At my firſt anſwer no man ſtood with me, but all men forſook me.</hi> Certainly if <hi>Peter,</hi> who for the ſame cauſe laid down his Life, had been there, he would not have forſaken him, but this is a proof he was not there: What <hi>Romaniſts</hi> ſay of a Conteſt between <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Simon</hi> the Sorcerer, and ſeveral other things to the like purpoſe, is all fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous: I know, in <hi>Rome</hi> they ſhew ſome places, with pretty Stories of their own Invention, as of <hi>Peter</hi>'s Priſon, and of his meeting with Chriſt, when ſtealing
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:174133:83"/>out of that City, to avoid Martyrdom; he aſked him <hi>Domine, quò vadis,</hi> Lord, whither goeſt thou, and the anſwer <hi>Romam ut ibi iterum Crucifigar,</hi> To <hi>Rome,</hi> there again to be Crucified; all forged and by Tradition tranſmitted to theſe very times: So that all this well conſidered, it doth not in the leaſt appear, that <hi>Peter</hi> came to <hi>Rome</hi> ſince <hi>Paul</hi> was brought thither, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, as we may conclude, according to what they ſay, that both ſuffered there at the ſame time: This Truth, <hi>Blondel,</hi> one well known for being verſed in the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, had promiſed the <hi>French</hi> National Synod at <hi>Charenton,</hi> which thereupon encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged with diſpenſing him from his uſual Paſtoral Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, invincibly to prove; and whileſt People were in expectation to ſee that Work of his come forth, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of his promiſed Book, having (as inform'd by a Worthy, Learned and Ingenious Man, who had known him, Named <hi>M. la Sigogne Ingrand</hi> of <hi>Poictiers,</hi> whom in my way through that Country, I happened to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with) been gained by Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> he publiſhed his Book about Pope <hi>Joan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After what I ſaid, the ſuppoſed Primacy of <hi>Peter</hi> is come to nothing, and conſequently the <hi>Supremacy</hi> of <hi>Popes</hi> and Church of <hi>Rome</hi> thereupon grounded, is blown up: So that one Pillar being pull'd down, the other, namely the <hi>Infallibility,</hi> cannot ſtand; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to proceed, I ſhall alter the order of my diſcourſe, for in the matter of Supremacy, I began againſt their Superſtructure before I meddled with the Foundation, that is, I ſhewed how the pretended Supremacy of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, is but a <hi>Chymera,</hi> and then that <hi>Peter</hi> had no Superiority over his Fellow Apoſtles, nor Dominion over God's Heritage, for indeed all the Power which the Lord hath given his Miniſters, is not to Curſe and Anathematize, as Popes and Councils have taken upon them to do, which is contrary to the Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern and Rule given by the Apoſtles in the Synod of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but as <hi>Paul,</hi> one of the chief of them, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares in ſeveral places, that<note n="(k)" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.10.</note> 
               <hi>Power is to edification, and not to deſtruction.</hi> But now I intend, by the Grace of God to demonſtrate, firſt, that <hi>Peter</hi> was not Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, and then, that in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, is no ſuch

            <p>But before I leave that Text, I muſt take notice of another Error which the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church would ground upon it, 'tis this, that the Power of the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, namely of binding and looſing, was beſtowed only upon <hi>Peter,</hi> when it alſo was upon the reſt of the Apoſtles, which were a Collective Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: Now to find out the truth of what I ſay, we muſt look upon the 13. <hi>Verſ.</hi> of this <hi>Chap.</hi> 16. of <hi>Mat. When Jeſus came into the coaſts of</hi> Ceſarea Philippi, <hi>he asked his diſciples ſaying, whom do men ſay, that I the ſon of man, am? and they ſaid, ſome ſay that thou art</hi> John <hi>the Baptiſt, ſome</hi> Elias, <hi>and others</hi> Jeremias, <hi>or one of the Prophets.</hi> Now ſeeing none of theſe Opinions of Men about him were true, he aſked their Opinion, for, <hi>he ſaith unto them, but whom ſay ye that I am?</hi> The Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is put to all his Diſciples, <hi>ye.</hi> So <hi>Peter</hi> in whom we commonly find a readineſs to ſpeak, as may be an effect of his temper, anſwered here in the name of all, thou art Chriſt the Son of the Living God, whereby he ſhewed an infinite difference between the Lord Jeſus and all that were nam'd before: But the better to ſee how the promiſe of the Keys, was not made in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular to <hi>Peter,</hi> but to the Colledge of the Diſciples, we muſt read the concluſion of that whole Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as 'tis in <hi>ver.</hi> 20. <hi>Then charged he his diſciples,</hi> not <hi>Peter</hi> alone, <hi>that they ſhould tell no man, that he was Jeſus the Chriſt,</hi> which implies, that tho' <hi>Peter</hi> alone had ſaid ſo, yet thereby all his Diſciples had owned him to be Chriſt the Son of the Living God, and as their Confeſſion concerning him was general, ſo was his promiſe. This on my way I thought fit to take notice of, to ſhew how ill grounded is the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church in her pretenſions.</p>
            <p>Now I return to <hi>Peter</hi>'s pretended Infallibility as to his Perſon, and ſay, that if ever he was infallible, it muſt be either before our Saviour's Death, or after his Reſurrection, and after he had been reſtored to his Apoſtleſhip, but neither of the two: Firſt, not before the Lord's Death, no Infallibility tied to his Perſon, ſince Scripture mentions ſome groſs failings of his, as his Ignorance in the Transfiguration, for when he ſpake of making three Tabernacles, the Evangeliſt
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:174133:84"/>obſerves of him,<note n="(ſ)" place="margin">

               <hi>Not knowing what he ſaid.</hi> A Man who knows not what he ſaith, is not infallible, nor he who wants Faith, wherewith Chriſt upbraided him, when he ſaid to him,<note n="(t)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 14.31.</note> 
               <hi>O thou of little faith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore didſt thou doubt:</hi> Again certainly <hi>Peter</hi> was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible when in the forequoted <hi>Chap. Mat.</hi> 16. the Lord having foretold his Death, Peter <hi>took him and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to rebuke him, ſaying be it far from thee, Lord; this ſhall not be unto thee,</hi> when for that ſame end he came unto the World, and without it there had been no Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which drew upon him this ſharp and unuſual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof of our Saviour, <hi>Get thee behind me Satan, thou art an offence unto me, for thou ſavoureſt not the things that be of God, but thoſe that be of men.</hi> This paſſage by the Evangeliſt, is related immediately after what had been diſcourſed between our Saviour and his Apoſtles, concerning what he was, <hi>v.</hi> 22.23. may be thereby to deſtroy all inferences that might after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards happen to be drawn on <hi>Peter</hi>'s behalf, to the prejudice and excluſion of the reſt of the Apoſtles, for therein any pretended Primacy and Infallibility are overthrown, and that circumſtance of time makes it remarkable: But if there was no other proof againſt his Infallibility, but that ſad Denial of his Lord and Maſter, even with an Oath to confirm a Lie, yea, Curſing and Swearing, and that thrice together, it were too ſtrong a proof againſt his Infallibility before our Saviour's Death.</p>
            <p>But I ſay alſo, he was not infallible after our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Aſcenſion, Witneſs St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who in<note n="(u)" place="margin">

               <hi>There is no man that ſinneth not:</hi> And I ſuppoſe a thing which is not, that one Man could be found, who in his whole Life-time had committed but one Sin, yet, ſaith the ſame Apoſtle,<note n="(z)" place="margin">

               <hi>Whoſoever ſhall keep the whole law,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:174133:85"/>and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.</hi> So then <hi>Peter</hi> was not infallible in the ſtate of Grace, and after his Repentance.</p>
            <p>Much leſs hath any ſuch thing as Infalibility, been entailed upon any that were to Succeed him, (grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which is not, the Popes to be his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors,) for there is not the leaſt ſtep thereof in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Experience teaches with a Witneſs how Fallible were his pretended Succeſſors. Before Men can well Diſpute about a thing, the Queſtion muſt be Stated, ſo before we come to Diſcuſs this Matter of Infallibility, let them firſt agree among themſelves where to Lodge it, which hitherto they could not; for ſome would have it to be in the Council, others in the Pope, and others in both Pope and Council together. The Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> which was held in 1414. Decreed the Council to be above the Pope, which is alſo a Laſh againſt his Supremacy, but in <hi>Italy</hi> this is accounted an Heretical Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
            <p>But why, to talk of Infallibility, a thing not be found in the World? To Lodge it in any Man, is to make a Contradiction, and Nonſenſe, for no meer Man was ever Infallible. Hence it is, that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture mentions flaws and failings in the beſt and moſt Holy Men, to begin from <hi>Adam,</hi> whoſe Fall Mankind hath cauſe to Remember, <hi>Noah, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, Lot, Iſaac, Joſeph, Moſes, Job, David, Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Jonah, Elijah</hi> that zealous Servant of God, of whom <hi>James</hi> ſaith, he was ſubject to the like paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as we are, <hi>Jeremiah, Peter, Paul, Barnabas.</hi> In few Words, Human Nature is attended with ſuch frailties, as render any Man ſubject to error and miſtakes; How then can <hi>Peter,</hi> or his pretended Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, even in <hi>Cathedra,</hi> as they term it, claim an Infallibility? By Vertue of what Priviledge, and whereupon grounded? Now let there be a Council of Men, and every one fallible, how then can the Council be Infallible? Can the number of Men alter Human Nature, when ſometimes as many Men as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Minds? Doth not experience ſhew, how grosſly Councils have Erred? We find them one ſet againſt
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:174133:85"/>another. The firſt of <hi>Nice</hi> condemned the <hi>Arrian</hi> Hereſy, which that of <hi>Arimini</hi> approved of. Yet tho' Men and Councils have Erred, we own there is an Infallible Rule, which if they follow they ſhall not Err, but not the Perſons, but the Rule is Infallible, becauſe it is the Word of an Infallible God: Now theſe immediate Inſpirations of the Holy Ghoſt, are not neceſſary, ast hey were at firſt, when the Goſpel of Chriſt was Publiſhed by the Miniſtry of Men, for then Men were to be convinced who it came from, and was approved by Heaven, but now it is ſetled, and hath been confirmed by ſo many Signs, Wonders, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and by the effectual and immediate working of the Holy Ghoſt, we need it no more to demonſtrate that truth which hath ſo often been proved, only we are to follow that Rule which Chriſt and his Apoſtles have left us, wherein he himſelf ſpeaks as from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>If then Councils be Fallible, why ſhall not thoſe Men whom they conſiſt of be ſo too? Which reaſon is by woful experience confirmed in the perſons of Popes, in whom others would Lodge the imaginary Infallibility of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, among whom their own Authors as <hi>Platina, Baronius,</hi> and others, own to have been Sorcerers, Blaſphemers, Whoremongers, Inceſtuous, Sodomites, Profane, Blood-thirſty, and the moſt abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable Wretches, Monſters, and Villains in Nature: How can men ſo notoriouſly wicked in Life and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, be Holy and Infallible in their Church about Spiritual things? Ask where was the Infallibility when at the ſame time there were ſeveral Popes, who Curſed and Excommunicated one another? At once the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> Deprived three, and did ſet up a Fourth one: Thus that pretended Infallibility of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church doth Reſide in Popes no more than in Councils.</p>
            <p>How then can Council and Pope, when together, be Infallible, if not ſo when aſunder? Can that junction alter their Nature? No more than a thouſand Sick Men can make one Healthful Man. This opinion tends only to Trim between the other two, perhaps to pleaſe them both, but things of this Nature, require more Sincerity, and leſs Policy: But this is the Spirit which
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:174133:86"/>Men of that Party are Generally acted by, as not long ago it plainly appeared beyond Sea: Lying, deſſemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and the like, <hi>Piae Fraudes,</hi> the Pious Cheats which they allow for the propagating their Religion; in <hi>France</hi> to promote the ruin of the Proteſtants, they made uſe of ſeveral different ways to make Proſelytes, a Bait they had for every kind of Fiſh, to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous they offered Places of Gain and Profit, to the Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, Money to buy Bread, and actually they made Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains and gave more Money to ſome, and leſs to others, to make them Change Religion as they did, which ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified the <hi>Merchandize</hi> which <hi>Babylon</hi> is ſaid to make <hi>of Souls of Men;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.13.</note> to the Ambitious they offered Honours, and to the Voluptuous, Means wherewith to ſupply their occaſions in that kind: And becauſe there was a ſort of People who had ſometing more of Honeſty than others, for theſe alſo they had a Bait; and this hath been the Method of the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux,</hi> tending to remove the abhorrency which ſome Proteſtants had againſt many of their Doctrines, therefore to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, or at leaſt to conceal the uglineſs and offence by many things they have among them, he Plaſtered and Painted ſome over, as to others he left it to their liberty to believe what they would concerning them: Only he Invited them to come in, with promiſe of Liberty for ſuch a perſwaſion as they were led in to by their own Judgement, they ſhould be free from going to Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and to their Communion, if they would but come to their Churches, they might Read the Bible in their Houſes, and ſuch like things; all which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ended in making Hypocrites; and 'tis well known what Place that way tends to. But ſome of their Zealots declared openly, they cared not, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or not, the Fathers and Mothers were Damned, if they might but make good Catholicks of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; thus to bring upon them the Wo our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our pronounced againſt <hi>the Scribes and Phariſees,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.15.</note> 
               <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites who compaſs Sea and Land to make one Proſelyte, and when he is made, they make him twofold more the Child of Hell than themſelves.</hi> So againſt the Rules of Chriſtianity and Charity, any ways, tho never ſo wrong, are good enough, if they can thereby compaſs their
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:174133:86"/>ends. Thus in the <hi>Indies</hi> the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> were content to ſee thoſe Infidels ſet up their Idols and Worſhip them, if ſomewhere behind they could lay a Crucifix, which they muſt need thereby to Adore together with the reſt. To all this I ſhall add, the great want of Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the <hi>French</hi> Government, for whileſt in that King's Declarations, he affirmed he would have the Edicts to be obſerved, at the ſame time the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons, by his Order, were upon their March to force the Proteſtants to go to Maſs.</p>
            <p>Now Madam, I found by your Diſcourſe, how you are much guided by the Method of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Meaux,</hi> and therefore I here beg leave to ſay, how what upon ſome of thoſe Matters he hath Publiſhed, Is not the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> from which he receded upon a Publick Account, and only for that time, to lay Snares for weak Conſciences; the Doctrines of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church are contained in the Canons of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and in the Writings of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin,</hi> and ſuch Authors of Note amongſt them, which I can aſſure you, are contrary to ſeveral things Written by that Biſhop of <hi>Meaux,</hi> whoſe opinion in thoſe things will not in <hi>Italy,</hi> paſs for the Doctrines of the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> And among others, I ſhall take notice only of one, about which you ſeemed to agree with me, and 'tis concerning the VVorſhip of Images, which <hi>Meaux</hi> would fain put a fine Gloſs upon, and you would be againſt it, but <hi>Madam,</hi> you therein differ from the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, (and I wiſh it were ſo in every thing elſe wherein they are in the wrong) for as to that Point, the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> doth refer it to the Canon of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Nicene,</hi> which ſaith, that whoſoever affirms that the Images of Saints are only to be Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, not Adored, let him be Anathema.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>Madam,</hi> not to exceed the due bounds of a Letter, and to conclude, I ſay, there is no ſuch a Superiority in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, or Primacy of her Biſhop over other Churches and Biſhops, and that the Titles of <hi>his Holineſs, Vice-God, God's Lieutenant, God
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:174133:87"/>upon Earth,</hi> which all are Anti-Chriſtian, and names of Blaſphemy, and all ſuch Offices, are unneceſſary in the Church: In the State, indeed Princes need Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, becauſe they cannot be every where, and ſtand in need of being informed, but 'tis not ſo of the Son of God, the Lord Jeſus, the Head and King of his Church, who ſees and knows all, of and by himſelf, and is preſent every where, therefore needs no Vicar up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth: And the Title of Viſible Head of the Church, is Preſumptuous and unneceſſary: And ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo there is no Infallibility either in Councils or Popes, or in any other Man, for we find Council a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Council, Pope againſt Pope, Doctor againſt Doctor, why then will you pin your Faith upon ſuch Sleeves: You may ſee how thoſe two, by them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted unſhaken Pillars, cannot Support it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I pray, <hi>Madam,</hi> give God the Glory, with your returning into the Boſom of the Church you have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken, wherein the Voice of Chriſt alone is heard, his Word alone is the Rule, and the Holy Ghoſt the only Guide, according to that Rule; for, <hi>Madam,</hi> the Word and the Spirit of Chriſt may not be ſeparated, for they go together, there you will find Peace, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, Aſſurance, and Reſt unto your Soul in Chriſt, whom we own to be the only Mediator and Saviour of the World: And ſo leave that Popiſh Church, which is a confuſed <hi>Babel,</hi> defiled with Inventions and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of Men, when in ours Chriſt alone Reigns, his Word and Voice alone is heard, known and followed, and he is our only High Prieſt, who once upon the Croſs, by the Sacrifice of himſelf, made atonement for our Sins, and now in Heaven, at the Right Hand of the Father, maketh Interceſſion for us, he is our All in All, and the deſire of our Souls, which can neither hope in or truſt to any Creature: Wherefore, <hi>Madam,</hi> break out with theſe Expreſſions, <hi>I will go and return to my Mother Church, for then was it better with me than now:</hi> You have forſaken Chriſt the Spring of Life, in whom alone is Salvation, and run to the Creatures Dead and Alive, which are not able to help you nor themſelves. God hath given you time to come to your ſelf, and to return to him, in the way of Repentance;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:174133:87"/>and to haſten you, he hath been pleaſed to ſet a mark upon you, therefore pray looſe no time.</p>
            <p>I hope, <hi>Madam,</hi> you will not take ill my Freedom and the plainneſs of Speech I uſe, for therein, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Byaſs, Self-end, or Worldly Conſideration, I aim only at the Glory of God, bearing Record for the Truth, and promoting the good of your Soul, which is the earneſt deſire and humble Prayer to God, of</p>
